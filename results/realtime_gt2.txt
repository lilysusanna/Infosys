The Harappan Civilization, also known as the Indus Valley Civilization, was one of the worldâ€™s earliest urban societies, flourishing along the Indus River in present-day Pakistan and northwest India. Major cities like Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro, and Dholavira were known for their well-planned streets, grid layout, and advanced drainage systems. The people practiced agriculture, trade, and crafts, and produced pottery, beads, and bronze sculptures.
