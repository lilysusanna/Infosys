I wonder how many meetings is talking about the stuff with the meetings. Yeah, I really, really stuff. Okay. So, what do we need to talk about? Should we just go around and everyone says what they've been doing? Is it without anything? Not at all. Why, I'm sorry. Yeah. Okay. Sounds like you've done something. Okay. Well, I've got a browser now, which, whoops. All right, go. Good stuff. Mm-hmm. Well, I dropped mine as well. Good at this. It wasn't the good stuff. Okay. So, yeah. We've got a browser, which comes up automatically with transcription box and the topics. And then when you go on the menu, you can select the summarisation box, which pops up, and an audio player. Right. And I think the search works as well. So, pop up a search. And it loads up just the background window, so empty. And so, when you start, you have to either open a particular observation or do a search, and open it through that. That like so? The transcription box has got a summarised button, which doesn't do anything yet. Now, I wonder how we want to do, you know, we want to pop up window with the speaker characterisation. Either we could do that, you know, when does the pop up come? Either we can, when you click on the ID, any sort of ID in the transcription box, or we can put an extra button, extra few buttons, next to the summarised button, so that you actually in the transcription box, but so that you click on the button and then it opens and so on. The problem is, the left click is already used because it highlights that part of speech or whatever that. So, the left click, or like it? The right click, like highlights it. So, that doesn't look like it. I don't know what happens when you double click actually, but that'll be a bit annoying if you have left click for one thing and double click for something like that. I think, so, yeah, when you left click it, you can for example set the marker there, so that the audio goes from there, I think. So, we can't put it on left click. We could for example have a little menu that pops up. Yeah, well, I'd be quite good, I suppose. So, right click on it menu, you know, and you can click on Speak Characterisation of Popsy and the... What else can we have in there? That's a good point. I don't know. So, otherwise we just have right click on the audio. Yeah, yeah, but I don't know about you, but usually in Windows, right click. Is it Windows? Do anything, does it? It opens a menu. Yeah, that's what it will be, does it? It might be a bit weird, but it's just not bringing up stuff in it, to just answer the same sort of idiom throughout. Yeah. Yeah. Or just, you know, or just the button. I guess the button makes a bit more sense, because otherwise you don't really know that, oh, what if I right click now? What happens then? Well, no, it's not official. Yeah, the menu is pop-up that. Well, oh yeah, it's more obvious, isn't it? It's more like a proof, isn't it? It's got a button. Yeah, that's true, yeah, it's more in Tuesdays. But, well, we have more things in the future than we have in the buttons. We'll work some menus. Maybe. More flexible. Well, I guess in meeting browser 1.1, you can have a menu instead of a button. Right, this one is... It's a bit of a bit of a... But actually, what we could do is, in that menu, as well, we could have an option that pops up a window with all the meetings that that user has been in, like a search for that user. Yeah. Is that going to be useful or too much? I guess so. So, part of the menu that comes down is, give me all your meetings. Yeah. So, when you right click on it, one option will be, give me all your meetings. Characterizes speaker. Yep. Was that too much, I mean? I guess so. I mean, it's more like part of the... browsing sort of thing more than the speaking character. Thirstyation? Yeah. Steve mentioned it. Yeah, that's true. Don't really know how to... Yeah. ...involve the speaking characters to the browser. Yeah, maybe tie that in with Biowaga, or something, as well as the speaker characterisation. I don't know. Just some way to sort of leverage that information. Like, we have it. We're doing it. But what... How does it help the browsing? Or what can it give us? Well, you mean the speaker characterisation? Oh, well. Yeah. I don't know about that. I mean, the speaker characterisation is a bit like you said. I mean, it's like a nice thing. We're not actually sure what the user wants for that, but it's interesting, so why don't you give it to him? Yeah, yeah. I think we should do it. Yeah. I mean, I guess maybe we could have that as another thing of... Well, if you get to speak a characterisation that someone talks a lot in a certain topic, and then if you click on that topic, you get everything that's in that topic. Yeah, I mean, that's still the level further. I mean, we're not even there yet. No, no, no. The pop of the speaker characterisation, we have to first define what happens when you click on a user. We have to have a speaker characterisation first, but we're crossing the other way over the other side. Yeah, yeah. So should we try to do a right click when you then? Yeah. All right. Why not? It's not just from the main. Even if any one's a big comment. Is that a particular window? Like if we want to sort of get... Like if we're on the users' versus like a topic or something, have a right click from for these various things. Yes. Wait, yeah. So the topic is the topic window. Do you want to somehow be able to click on the topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that? Right. Yeah. Yeah. So we could do that in a similar way. Do it right click as well. Okay. So this lot is for our... This is for our system through. Yeah. On the speaker. So, yeah. So we have basically two options of browsing the meetings is by either searching and opening individual observations. And then we have the interlinking by right click. Okay. Actually. Yeah. Like another common thing. Like if we have it sort of set up that... If you double click and it goes to a default thing on the menu, I mean that's kind of a typical kind of... Double click. If you double click on a particular topic or something, then it goes to sort of like a default. So it will be like all the... Um, cases of that topic either... Whatever we decide the default to be, whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting, and just show up the particular instances of that topic in the meeting. Like, I just think to have the default there. So if somebody knows exactly what they want to do, and we know that that's the most common thing that's going to happen. Yeah. So the double click will do that and just say from the trouble of right click and choosing the item on the menu. Obviously there's anything obvious that would be about... That would be... It might come to us. Let's just start playing with it. What was that? I think I understand. You mean... Like we have to have the right click menu, the right click, but instead of... Like, how do you default double click? So it will be a choice one of the most common... Yeah, exactly. ...used to double-f. Like, I don't know. Show the speaker character situation. For instance, or... Then there's the problem with a lot of windows popping up again. And they pop up without you being quite sure what it is. Yeah. But if you do double click on something, don't you expect something to happen? Then... Yeah, then you should have... So I'll touch it at once. I'll go away. Stop coming up. I'll turn it closer. Yeah. It's not... It's nothing to the world. Especially if you haven't touched pan. Yeah, that's all there. Yeah. Well, I'll check what it does on the double click at the moment. Yeah. Because I think it might do something. Good start. But I don't really... I really don't see anything obvious that... I mean, if you can think of something on it. Mm-hmm. Sorry. I guess I'll put some... The... Yeah. What you're clicking on. Sorry. Yeah, another thing... Single audio. Do we want to use them or not? We don't know yet. Do we hear it, David? Do you mean single channel? Yeah, single channel. The single channel files. Do we want them? I mean... Probably not, but we might need them for the influences. If we try to do it in order. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But... At the moment, no. To work with them, but... Do we want to integrate them so that when you browse, we can... We might want to be able to say, oh, yeah. We might want to be able to do it in order. Yeah, yeah. We might use them in the world. At the moment, no. But... To work with them. But... We might want to be able to say, oh, just give me what that person's saying. Do you, though? No, no. You're not going to make much sense if you're not listening to it. Do you? Unless I'm... You can't hear it properly or something. Somebody's talking over some of the else or something. Well... We're just saying note for now and put it in my mouth. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because otherwise it will... The increase in amount of data we need for, I'm not going to... Yeah. This will put more people. Yeah. Yeah. Um... Yeah, what do people think in general about the Windows cluttering that you mentioned? Do you think... Do you think we probably need that? Don't have the full flexibility. We need to have that. That's what I feel. I mean, I'm very much... I want to have everything customizable. Well, the thing is typically, though, is someone going to have five windows open at the same time. Probably not. Probably not, no. Two or three of whatever. Whatever they're looking for. Yeah. Whatever. But, yeah, it depends. I mean, I really want to put the summary in somewhere, you know. And in the summary, for example, typical, you open the window, you read through it, you might click on, you know, close it against right away. Yeah. But it'd be good to have it there. I think it's fine. But, well, couldn't we... I mean, you probably... I don't know if you want to have like the full transcription and the summary at the same time. So maybe you can just like choose the same window for transcription and the summary. It's like having a town there. I was just going to have to have three points. Yeah. Taps are nice. Yeah, tapping it. Like a gazillion. Yeah. That's right. I'm not sure. Yeah. I don't know. Did anyone know how to do that? I can't do that. I don't know. I don't know. I probably can. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure you can do anything. You really need what you're doing. I don't know. It's a bit of a cripple job as we're going to get the eight sometimes. It's a bit of a cripple. I can have a look. Yeah. Yeah. We're just... I don't know. But yeah, that might be an idea. It might be an idea. It might be an idea. Yeah, yeah. It might be an idea. Contents of the same window. Yeah, yeah. Like from transcription to summary. Yeah. Yeah, we're even just have buttons on it. Talk about buttons or something on the toolbar. That window. Hmm. That's something. Yeah, yeah. That could go... It doesn't have to be a cab or whatever. No, no. It could be like transcription summary. Yeah. Like two betters. And you just press on the button. Or checkmarks you can have. Yeah. That will reduce the number of windows. Yeah. Which is for you. Otherwise, Photoshop has a lot of windows. If you have a used Photoshop Scott loads and you're always good forever going. And I'll get out of the way. There's always stuff in the way. Yeah. I don't want to. What do you mean people get used to it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Unless Kenny, I don't know, especially you can minimize them and stuff like that. Yeah, you can't minimize them. Can you do that? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Well, of course you can. Yeah. Like a lot of these can be like once we get the disfluencies out then we can you know, transcript without the disfluency transcript with the diploma. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. That's true. They're definitely sort of using the same window. Yeah, they're definitely going to be in the same window. Yeah. They're probably mutually. What do you think is the exclusive? Yeah, that was the plan for the disfluencies anyway. Yeah. So, yeah, do you want to do that with summaries and put the summaries in the same window? Meet tree. Yeah. Well, I don't know. You know, with transcripts, it sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three old turners then, like full meeting, meeting without disfluencies and suburites. Yeah. Do you want to do that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sounds good. Yeah. And finally, the prototype is fake about what kind of prototype could be produced. I'm just going to the lab and I say, what am I going to change today? And it kind of just develops. I'm not aiming for anything. Do we want aim for something? I'm pretty much getting there anyway. It's not going to be a lot more work. I guess it is. I mean, just to try and, I mean for us to be able to do something that we can include with your thing. Yeah, that's what we need to do. Something just slightly more than just that on its own. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just so see the integration works. Sort of between the different couple. Yeah, definitely. So I guess that's what we need to be doing for. I think that's kind of what I meant as well. Yeah. I think it's sort of start to do stuff rather than just be. I'm trying to type it to GUI. Yeah. Well, I guess I mean, that was probably our intention, but we might not have written it down. So yeah. Yeah. Actually, is the code accessible like the GUI stuff that you've done? Like can we just copy the latest stuff out of your directly? Like if we're going to just try and take a look or something. I don't know. Can we access other people's things? You can make it world-readable then anybody can. If you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable then we know the directory to get in. Yeah. Sure. I don't know if it's readable at the moment, but you can show it up. I don't know if you buy defaults. Yeah, they're not world-readable. They're not done with defaults. They're only defaults. Then only you can read them. All right. You can see them, but you can't read them. Okay. All right. Well, I'll make that readable then. So the directory is my number. Or you could just email. Okay. Yeah. Well, it's not difficult. What's your number? Okay. It's in all the emails. Yeah. Your number. Not 04. Okay. 04. 545. 6.0. Who's that again? 04. 04.555.6.0. And then it's. And then there's a folder in LSSD. And it's called the embrowser. The embrowser. Yes. I want to use. I hope you never have to look in my directory. It's just pure chaos. No, I'm extremely ordinary. I've got all the same thing. I'll look full. The mind is serious chaos. I'll see. It's a chaos. It's a chaos. It's a chaos. It's a chaos. It's a chaos. It's a chaos. It's a chaos. It's a chaos. Yeah. So that's me, then. Someone else want to talk about their stuff? I know, jump at once. I can tell you what I've done in SB2. I know. I don't know. I basically started browsing a bit just like trying to see if that's the right thing. I didn't see if there's anything out there to use it. What were you doing in general? Yeah. Search for it. Yeah. I'm going to search for it. Yeah. I'll search for it. I'll search for it. Yeah. I'll search for it. I'll search for it. Yeah. I found a tutorial that inverted search indexing. I haven't read it yet. I'm going to use that code. Like that was behind the question chest. Yeah. We're using code in stuff. It's like, okay. That's pretty much it. That's pretty much it. Yeah. Well, I don't know if it's usable. I haven't looked at it, but I found some code for like from a tutorial about indexing. Cool. Cool. So even if it doesn't work, you can jiggery put great around and make it work. Yeah. Probably stuff to do some other file management while I'm cringey. Yeah. Yeah. So this is an nonsense. Yeah. But the basics is that I can't do it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you think it shouldn't be too difficult? I don't know. I was a bit worried about one. I talked about this with a file. I said, I would file. I mean, how much do we actually need to do like extracting things from the XML files and stuff to be able to do the mixing? Oh, I see. Yeah. I have to convert it to something for more. Yeah. I've been trying to write something to read the XML and get rid of it. And I can get rid of it, but I'm having trouble pointing anywhere else. So it'll come up on the screen. Further moment, I haven't managed to put it into a vector or whatever in Java to play with it. Are you writing in Java? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you look at the browser code then because they already extract for example transcripts. Yeah. I'm sure they do. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm sure I'm making a made of it. Yeah. I guess, I mean, it was a good point you have that like collaborating with file things. I mean, if you already started on. Yeah, yeah. It's absolutely. Yeah. We can share as much as possible. Yeah. Why worries? Yeah. Yeah. Should we, I don't know, meet up and see what we could do. I mean, I don't know, see what you've done and see what we need. Yeah. Where we know more. Maybe next week. Next week. I'm done. Yeah. So you're still. Actually, you haven't done anything this week because this week's been manic. Yeah. Exactly. I mean, this week's only two days old. Well, whatever it was last week. The week as it is rather than the proper week, you know, it's been all a bit manic. Well, last week. We were in SPNLP and SP2, right? That's right. Yeah. And then we had to do an IRP whatever it was last week as well, which is only a page long. But it's quite difficult to write a page. Yeah. Yeah. That's completely. It was. I have to say anything about it for a bit. It's a bit irritating. Yeah. But SPNLP. Yeah. Come on. Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, I was thinking that we'd generally. Yeah. We're starting tacking this seriously. I'm just, you know, hopefully I'm something by next week that we can sort of try and do it into a degree. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, it's not as well. The browsers I use it now or as, you know, it was there when I took it. And it uses the NXT search to get the data out of the files, which I think is odd, but I'm not quite sure how it works. I don't quite understand. So, when it, when it. To get the data, for example, to get the summarization data, you have to search for, I think, the ID's on something. Yeah. That's pretty good. I guess that's right. Where it's got the. That is very good. So they don't, you know, they don't say, look in that folder. Yeah. Search everything. That is pretty good. Well, they did say it wasn't the most efficient. They just wrote up quite great. But, you know, what it is like, we know where you have to write a search query or is it just what's behind it? No, this is not the actual search. It's just when you open, you know, to load the transcript, for example, to find the transcript for a certain meeting. It does the NXT search for the string, I don't know, transcript or text or whatever. And it, like, it just has an open variable, transcript, whatever, find everything that's got that. Yeah. So, I don't know if you've looked at the search query language, but it's like a dollar, a text. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because that's the, I think, the class of variable doesn't have any. And then, yeah. Because every, every of all of these, these files have got an ID and all the transcript files have got the string. I don't know what it is, words or text or something. So, I just search for those files. Okay. Maybe. When you, like, is there an open thingy or a word, like, what did you do to, like, how did you figure out that this uses NXT search? Is it, well, it's in the code. You know, you define a search object and then you search that string. I had to figure out how to, how to do the same thing for the summary. That's the way. I have to understand how to do the transcript, how they did the transcript to do some of the stuff. So, did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it? Is that what you did? Yeah. Just search for this specific string. What? That's exactly. You could just, you know, you could use that when you, if you want to take the data out. I was just thinking that, you know. If you have a question about what the code means or where to find the code that you want to, you know, whatever you want to do, then just send me email. I can explain it. Have you annotated your code? Oh, yeah. Actually, in the moment, it's got a load of rubbish because the, the, the browser that I used from, you know, that they gave us had a lot of extra stuff in. And I'm dead, thrown out, just throughout all the functions of the house. Distantation. Yes. Yes. So they're all in there, yet still a lot of rubbish. But we'll be, we'll be chucked out right at the end of it. Coming, coming, coming, seeing it out one bit at a time, running it. Yes. Going to get that next. It's so easy. Good finally. So basically we got kind of this work really nice. Yeah, that's interesting. The rest of that is a bit of log in the short. Oh, we can. But we can still four days off. Yeah, four. Still a little bit of an amount, is there? How much is this? I don't know. I actually have that much to do. Well, should you be following in here, to explore any other. How should you, how should you, how should you, um, quantify a raising? I can't remember what I'm supposed to do, by the way. Am I supposed to do the summarisation thing, you both? No. Who was doing it? You do. Oh, really? Yes, I will. Well, I'll do that then. This can be changed. So I do that then. I don't know, it doesn't matter. Well, you know. If you want to, I mean, let's just play around with some extra stuff. I have some time. Why not? It shouldn't be too difficult. So what courses should I pick? I'm not doing any work. Yeah. Well, I'm doing communications of which we had one exercise and I've done that like two weeks ago. That's in two weeks. So in Paradox? Of course. Yeah, so. Oh, it's like nine. Nine courses a little ten or something. Okay. Oh, so is it, yeah. And then I'm doing, um, parallel programming languages and systems. Which we had one exercise as well. And not saying like Friday. Well, I'm not doing any background reading. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. I'll be happy when this week is over. I'll be happy when these courses are working. Yeah. Yeah. I knew it was out of bed. I don't know. Anything else we need to discuss? I don't know. Did we want to meet before we talk to Steve next week? Well, I don't know. We'll probably get some work done over the weekend. So I know after DNLG or something, we just have a little quick little update. Yeah, I feel like. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so what are you planning to do over the weekend then? Switch. You're going to do the search. You're going to open the search. Sure. Yeah. Couldn't be down on it. Well, it'll be, you know, still limited version of, you know, the next query. Won't be the whole thing. Like we can just decide sort of things that we do want to do. Actually, most of us just don't want to ask some. There's so many topics. It's just not, I think we need to set ourselves some milestones because otherwise. Yeah, we'll get. Yeah, that's great. Yeah. Like you said, like actually, do we want to set a date for interim prototype specifically? I did. Oh, you decide. I'm not. The progress of board is June 23rd, February. February. What's that to me? Um, yeah. Well, how about we get it done by then? I mean, yes, yeah. Then we can write about it in the interim report. Yeah. You know, we've got some. Okay. So. I'm just looking at my own deadlines. Yeah. When the search interface, maybe you should decide pretty, pretty early what kind of things you want to be able to search for. And then if you want, you can give out to me now. I'll build you nice, you know, a few tick boxes and drop down my news. Like what do you have now? Wasn't that pretty much what we read on or what? Oh, that's that's the one that doesn't exist. That's completely cut and pasted. Oh, okay. That does not exist. Nice. He's done the moment. It's actually all these all these things that are mixed from, you know, all these drop down menus and tick boxes are nicked from Google. It's a screenshot of Google. That's not it. I'm impressed. Maybe you should make it exist then. It's going to be a little difficult, more difficult. Yeah, I mean, I was going to, but, you know, the whole drop down menus and stuff, what we want to search for is not quite agreed on. We never agreed on what we want to be able to search for. Nice. No, it's not. I don't know. Yeah, do you want to, you know, just get together and think about different types of search we could possibly do. And then we could discuss that next meeting, which options we really want to include. That would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do. It would be nice to, I don't know, meet up and you can sort of show us a bit, but you know, we don't sort of have to do all the work again, you know, just like figuring out stuff. Oh, just have the basics. No, already. Just like accessing the corpus and stuff. Oh. Just like all the, unseeing the code and just sort of how, just see the basics of what you've done. Just get a quick look over and just take it through a tutorial. Yeah. You know, the class paths, all that sort of thing. Just say, okay, well, here's everything's basically settled. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just showing you what right. The code. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. In the morning. Yeah. Well, there's some IMD. JT. Right. You can't do anything. The only thing is, you know, something like that could happen anytime because, yeah, like my schedule is like a class, break, class, break, class. Yeah. I was not going to take it out. Yeah. That's what I'm thinking. So something like that, and then if I have a class, I can run off and do it. Yeah. Pick your time. Yeah. Yeah. Monday. Monday might be good. Yeah. What? Monday. What do you think? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm thinking. I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, Monday. Monday might be good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's an option too. Yeah. Yeah. Three is good. But we have. Wow. What's your, what's your, R330? I'm just. Yeah. That's a nice. Three in the, in the computer room in here, and then we can just go in there, though. If you can't, can you get in the front door? Yeah. Oh, we haven't got a key. You can not have you get in. Yeah. Through the computer rooms in here, the M.S.C. computer room. I've not found that yet. That's in here. Well, if you find me, I'll show you where I'll let us all in there. We can look in there. We can look now afterwards. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You do need to have a key for it. Yeah. Somebody was asking Steve about that, whether we can get in there. What if he's gonna get us access into a work. The computer room. Okay. Yeah. It's only got his crap. It's only got about four or five convinced it would do quite a good job. to do quite good for our job because it can also, that's not very of not many people in it, right? Is there a printer in there too? Yes, and there's a fatescop here with the code on it, yeah. Well, I'm just going to put it here. I'm going to put it here. I'm going to put it here. I'm going to put it here. I'm going to put it here. Yeah, I'm going to put it here. So what time do we say? I just think it's better to do afterwards than we have all the time. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, then half an hour and then we'll actually run out. Yeah. As long as D-Mail, she doesn't go on late. Hopefully it's not that man's hurt, it won't matter. Actually, it's not even confirmed yet. Was? She doesn't even know what she's talking about. Maybe it doesn't happen at all. It's really weak next week. Should be. Should it really? Well, it's supposed to be next week. Next week. It's weeks next week. I don't think we have a reading read. I don't know. We have one class at least. When we like speech perception, we don't have any lectures, but I think we haven't like all other classes. So I don't think there's not my point. I don't think there was an official one last semester. I think it was just a bank call. There was not. Something like that. I think one of a couple classes. Some classes did and some classes didn't. Yeah, we should have been quite bad. Yeah, they didn't really know what was going to happen. I think the undergraduate had a world. He was up to the professor. I think he did it or not. Well, I don't feel like it. Yeah, I think it worked. I think the IL will probably have one to make up for missing classes. What? The IL will probably have a lot of classes. Yeah, we will probably have. Yeah. Last week. Okay. She's me Monday. Yeah. Um, I guess that's it. Was there anything else? Do anyone know you want to like take care of this or should I take care of it? Oh, wait, trust you. Yeah. I don't know if there was something. I think he basically said the same thing says in the comments. If I could read it. Can we read that? Um, really want multiple windows from a single app? We'll probably want to go with the faults.
