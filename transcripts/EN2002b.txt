Okay. Okay. Okay. Who wants to take notes today? Oh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Who wants to take notes today? Oh. Okay. Who wants to take notes today? Oh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll take notes this time. What? I'll take notes this time. Okay. I'll make funny drawings. Actually, I guess first thing I just sort of did a really sort of brief, um, yeah, version of what we have to do. Yeah. Actually, I'll just take a note. Thank you. Okay. Very interesting start of the meeting. Yes. Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay. Yes. Okay. What time? Actually, for that, I was just copying the one straight out of the other documents. So it's all whatever. Yeah. Can I cut it? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Is it? Oh, should I show you? I'm not sure if we need the outline as a prototype. I mean, what we're going to put into that? Well, just sort of, well, the thing is, yeah, we're going to be touching on all that during the other part of the process. Yeah, because I'm putting that screenshot in our branch. Yeah. Well, it's just something that he had mentioned in the previous, like just to sort of have a prototype together and sort of just saying that, you know, we could potentially do that. Yeah. We can find something we have to. And let's just just describe some screenshots. Yeah. Sure. Like the thing is, I was thinking, even, you know, stuff that I was doing, I mean, just throw the screenshots in there when you talk about what you're doing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Actually, yeah. I have that at the very end screenshots, but that didn't show up on this page. I just have a bunch of them in one section. Anyways, so, so yeah, this is just very general structure. I guess from this, we can just pop in our little blurbs and, you know, yeah. Oh, right. And that's not my intention. Cool. So I know if there's other stuff that you think should be done to this, I could do that before I meet with you guys. Otherwise. That's what I want to throw it together. Actually, I can probably still throw it together if you want. Put your parts into this one. I think the finished it did. Perfection. Yes. That's a good idea. Let's just cut out the middle first. Yeah, exactly. I'm going to tell you to go ahead and roll anyways. And I'm being like, oh, maybe speak low English. Yeah. Yeah. Also, if you want to keep going about, I'm happy to do some as well. I have lots of time tonight. And then we send it to you. You can do the file already. Yeah. I'll look at it like when my usual working hours are like from 12 o'clock to three o'clock or something. I know if you can work in the lab. I know. It always makes me feel bad. When I go to bed at like one, you're still online. You never go to bed. It's me. I just need your computer on maybe. You're 10. Always busy. You're actually not. So maybe. But I'm never online on the morning so. Yeah. You notice that no one is. So. Okay. So I'll send it off you. Yeah. Do what you want to do with. Forks and then I'll. Yeah. And I'll send it out to you again. Was there anything else we wanted to add to the timeline? I mean, essentially was what? Yeah. You can't see either right there. There's the old one. Oh, there's more. Well, that's the original one. Oh, this is the one that. Yeah. Yeah. Which just copied straight up. Probably want to think about it. If we want to change. What goals and stuff. I think one thing that we could probably skip. Totally is the removing things from the body of fire. That's what I thought as well. I mean, do we. Are we actually going to attempt that? No. I don't think so either. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's going to be. We don't even know how to approach that. Yeah. It's a good thing to have to say. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Unless we discover some sort of time warp things. Yeah. Yeah. That's definitely one thing. So maybe we should definitely. Well, we could probably not put it under this heading, but put it under changes in the initial specification. Yeah. And say, yeah, we didn't. We decided the time is too short. We felt there were more important things in a little time than we did. Yeah. I didn't worry about that. We preferred to concentrate on the main. Yeah. And I think we should probably comment explicitly on the milestones here as well. And say, we managed to do. Yeah. Or some of them were a bit later. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Best fall on target. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, it's not finished, but. Somebody got six days to do the top execments. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you can say, yeah. Speaking of it. Speaking of it. We're still aiming for the. She's. The men to be completely in the match. Speaking of it. It's supposed to be done already. Oh, really? Yeah. T-dice kick. Oh, yeah. For one of those, something that you want to change and delete from our list of expectations. Give me a week and I'll tell you the answer. I'm going to. Yeah. Like, should we put it a hint that something like that might happen into the document? Maybe their speaker characterization may get slimmer. Yeah. That's right. I really want to do it. We won't disappear now. Yeah. It's not going to be difficult. If at least have all the information pop up that is already in the meta-vator file. Yeah. That's going to be in the work. Yeah, true. Yeah. So it's definitely going to be something. Yeah. I like it to disappear, but we might thin it down a bit. But we might not. You never know. Yeah. We might turn out even more. I don't know. The topic segmentation with LC Second Textiles basically done just to be. Done. It's tuned. Yeah. The code here tuned here. Search for the parameters, but he's man. I was on the. See what happens. Yeah. That's good. Awesome. Yeah. Sounds good. I know. Should we change? Sorry. We should probably do another responsibility of packages as well. That's what he hinted that we should also indicate who he's responsible for. Right. Like probably just copy that straighter the other one as well. He's pretty much essentially the same. More detail specifically. Well, you could put. Yeah. Should we add on. We think Mike, but our things that we have together should we. Those are part. Yeah. I mean, we have. You know, like you heard it and you have the other. But what about them? I'm on this. What if we're skipping the audio one and then please have easier. Yeah. We just keep it together on the paper. Have you taken it right now and just see what? Have you taken any more of the cut it? No, not the disfuls. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Probably. No, but I've tried to look at that report. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We could just make it up. Yeah. So. Like I'll claim one. You claim the other for the search things and then we could leave that one as a joint one. Yeah. Have you managed any further on the search thing? I found. Finally. Today. Something that I can build it in. And it's, uh, I should have something for tomorrow. I should have, you know, at least very least have a gooey. I'm wearing. I'll be wearing that in. I'll put it tomorrow morning. So. I want to get something. I want to see this. I want to get together. I have an image in my mind. I want to see it. Yeah. Yeah. On the thing and then. Ganesh can chat. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My intent is to. Work on this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My intent is to. Work on these things tomorrow with more as well. So. I don't know. We send it in the afternoon. Maybe I can add a few sentences to what I'm done. It really matter. I mean, you can write the sentences first as well. I mean, with the. The tension that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's not. Sometimes. Sometimes. A bit of a motivating factor too. I mean, write down the words and the ideas as. Oh. Okay. Well, it is. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I think it's fine with the data for it. The embedded file. That's how it comes out. I don't know. Well, I still like struggling with Java stuff. I am. Yeah. But. I am. Okay. More kind of. I think I was wondering about that is. I haven't looked at it so much, but if. In any case, now. How we could do that? Like, from the. Extract words that you did. Like, also, extract. Time. So. I'm not going to. I don't know. I'm. I don't know. What's your name. I'm not going to. extract times them. So yeah, we're just when they pull up the segments. Yeah. Part of that, one of the attributes, if you do get attributes, call them ethically. If it turns a list of attributes, search through those and then just you can tell tell you what attributes has got. Okay. And then you leave the automatically or you can just hard code and say look, get me the timestamps. So you just say get attribute and put, I think the maths is called get attribute. Okay. It's called start time and end time. Okay. And that'll tell you the start time and end times. Okay. I think it returns a double. Okay. Yeah. So now I could just put it in some. Yeah. That's on the, the the non-right element. What on the object is a non-right element? Okay. So is there, did you, have you made another ember? Is there something that I... There is, but I haven't made a lot of changes to it. So I might just delete what I've done and copy again from yours. Because I'm sure you've probably made some changes already. No, since you looked at it. I don't know. So Friday? Okay. I thought you said, okay. I thought you said that you had written some things that maybe have caused some bugs in that you were pixels on an account or something. No. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay. Although there's stuff out there that actually I'm going to try and minimize the amount of changes that make the embers or anyways. Shouldn't, shouldn't be an issue. Actually, just to clarify last week when we're talking about our search results. Like if we have topics as well as transcripts as well as other summaries. Do we want separate results, pains for each of those or do we want them all in one pain with like an icon or in different colors or something to indicate what type of result they are. So then when they click on that it's going to go to the relevant thing. Like just if they check all three say topics summary, probably have three different windows come up or three like some pain sort of. At the moment is there a window that comes up or is that a second result pain or is that you know window get larger. I think what we sort of discussed last week was to have it sort on the same window. So it'll be on the search window, the bottom half of the search window. I know we still want to keep it that way but that's what it's going to be working on. So it's just like you click those and it's just loads up. Yeah. Split that thing into two or three or whatever it is. One, two, three depending on which ones you check. And then so if we want to do it that way, you know, like it probably doesn't matter too much. Just try to think if there's going to be any other issues down the road depending on what you confuse me. Do you have three separate windows for the three separate different types of rooms? No, just just pains just result pains. Okay, not three different. No, no, no, no, no. So it's just when we click you know topics and summaries for what we want to search then a little group, you know, there'll be two result pains. So for the top six, I don't know really tabs. I like the idea of tabbing that. But then you can see all of them at the same time. But you want to compare the result, the topic one topic result with one summary result. Well, it's no, but the thing is if you're looking, if you could check them both, you want to see all the results. Yeah, if you get results for the same team. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so the summary and the topic and then transfer. Yeah, that's true. Or we could just put them all into one result pain. Yeah, I mean, we could order them by meeting Oh, yeah, I guess that was the other thing whether we want to have this Reorder by. Yeah, well, I mean, if that's a house. Yeah, that's the second step. The first question is do we want to order them? How do we want to order them in the first place? Yeah, I think yeah, probably by meeting makes most sense. I mean, essentially they're, you know, in time order. So, yeah, that kind of makes most sense. Yeah, maybe we should do that. Yeah, yeah, should be an easy, well, I don't know, it should be fairly I guess. Yeah, why don't you just color code those? Yeah, the results too. Thinking sometimes in case like that, like a run across some in other languages, just that it's hard to tell what kind of object it was originally, once it's put into like a list box or something, it's hard to tell whether it was a transcript or whatever and then we're highlighting something in a transcript window, it may be difficult to get that information back once it's just in all this box, and I had them in all this box. So, but, where's if it's coming from? If you do it straight from, you know, you get the result, and then there's some if statement saying straight on the rock bottom level saying if you found a segment then correct, print it, and then red or wildlife. Yeah, yeah, as opposed to, yeah, yeah, it's just like from past experience, there's goofy little things that happen and just doesn't let you save certain things and it's just kind of trying to do a different kind of, to go to a different window, so if you want to go to the actual highlight the transcript, highlight the topic. At that point, that sort of way it starts getting a little bit tricky, because you're working with an event handler within the one panel or a list box or whatever it is. Oh, see, yeah. There are ways around it, but you know, whether I'll be able to figure something out like that before tomorrow, you know, or delegates or whatever. Yeah, I mean, at the moment it works, it works with highlighting in the transcript window, doesn't it? So, I think you were saying that as long as we implement that interface, it should work with anything that we do, like highlighting, I think that was, who's saying that? What do you mean you should work with anything? Um, was it Jonathan saying something more than? I think it was just like, as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window, we should be able to have that highlighting happen. Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah, I mean, the whole, um, what feels the transcription box and all of these boxes is a special sort of pain made by night. Okay. I'm not sure what it's called now. I don't know what it's called. And that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well as I said, you know, if you, if you've left click on something, for example, it highlights automatic things. Okay. So maybe it comes with something. Okay, maybe I should use that as well. Yeah. Yeah. It's called a night text pane. No, I'm just going to paint it. Night. I don't know. Text area. Yeah. No, it takes it. Mostly it's called normal. Yeah. Why? Why? Not anywhere. Night object model. Okay. I think that's what it is. What? Night object model. I think that's what I need to do. Okay. Um, with the, um, the removing the disperses, if you've done anything with that, yeah. Anybody? No. No. Because I'm, I was wondering how we're going to write it back to HTML. I mean, XML, if we take, if we did the processing, writing it back to XML, I thought we were just going to have that as words like not as XML, just sort of as a, as a blouse of text, what was I done? Text, but on transcript. You said, no, no, no, because then we need all the other data. We want to keep it a transcript. You were very much limit what you can do with it. It's not necessarily. That's really a point. There is some bizarre method that puts things back into XML. Why do, why do we want it in XML? I mean, I thought we, we just selectively, selectively write the XML that we've got. So as, as opposed to, oh, select what we want, just take bits of the XML, take, only take certain segments. Yeah, yeah. Only print out certain, certain segments of segments that we want, just selectively. At the moment, it prints out all of them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll just put an if we'll open it that leaves out some of the prints. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Not, not store it at all whatsoever. Okay. Is that, oh yeah. That's what I think we, like, yeah, that's what I think we want. That's what I think we want. Actually, but this makes more sense. That will mean that you can only do things, actually, now, because you can think of them at a word level. So yeah, that's fine. Yeah, and we're going to do the XML one. Fine. We're not really, well, I mean, we're not going to do much more than just look at the, the room, like, the text for remove these lenses, because we're not going to search it, and we're not going to, like, listen to it. Yeah, this one I'll do the audio thing. Yeah. So I guess just displaying it is. Right. But yeah, yeah, we need to do much more with it. No, that's right. But I think it's like, well, how would we display the, like, if we do take this from these out and just, you know, create a text file, take the discipline to the text file. It would just be a blurb like a summary. Yeah. Well, it would like, it won't say, speaker X says this, speaker Y says that, because it says this. Well, as we extract that out of the file when we create the text file, they will look like, let's just let you want to start. It's probably the best thing to do. I think it's going to take long to, to, to, to, anyway, it's just a lot of, I mean, these meetings are not endlessly long. It's just words and to print all of them out selectively. It doesn't want to find you. Yeah. So then it just goes through and says, this word equals that imprint. Yeah. Yeah. It's a bunch of statements. You can nearly do it together with, with the transcription, with the original transcription, having them run parallel. So if, so, you know, if it's a proper word, print it on both, both pains, and if it's not proper word, then print it on your one. But I mean, that's, that's, you know, fancy bit. Yeah, it probably could actually, it's probably less probably not that, or just in fact, in the code out a bit. Yeah. But then, you know, the, the, the good way of doing it, not together is that if someone doesn't want to look at the, the, you know, the chop file, then you don't ever have to produce it. Yeah. So. But I mean, you can, you know, you can write, we can write something like, we'll try and do it on the fly and, and observe if that kind of, is going to take too long, if it's going to take too long, well, think about writing it to a file. It shouldn't be. It's just, they just be, if statements, when they, they're not, they're statements. Or, I mean, I was just thinking, you know, I mean, we've probably been used like, XSL teat, kind of just transform it, you know, flip it into, what is that? Just, uh, transforms, like, um, style sheet, um, XML, file sheet, and then it's kind of like there's usually things built into, well, it should be built into JL, I mean, to process, XML into, like, and just creates, whatever file it's going to be in, it's been a couple of years since I looked at anything like this, but, uh, that might even be an easier way. And then that way we could even pre-process that, but why? I don't know, well, we don't want to have to do that, right? Although, although I'm not flying, it's to be able to take it back into a quick, quick job, but even trying to read it in XML, which I've always, a couple of days, I gave up to it in that, I really, I've devoted back to, uh, night stuff, because it was much, much, much easier. Yeah. So we did it with night stuff, did it with night stuff. Yeah, okay. Yeah. And Java, trying to do it, it was just so complicated. Okay. Yeah. And believe it, you have to start defining object models like the, like, thing in the game. Yes, sure. All of these are, um, weird things on the internet. Actually, I was thinking I might try and talk to, who is it Jonathan and Gene? Like, just to see what they, what system they used to develop this stuff, because it would be nice to have all the tools there and just like, have the object model and just kind of like plug and play with everything and just actually use a system, you know, at a higher level rather than kind of, you know, playing around with a little bit of code and modifying their code and doing this and that. It's nice to just sort of see what they're doing. So I might, uh, try and contact them, see if there's any other hints that you give us. Just to get things, I don't know, moving at a higher level, I guess. It seems to be more interesting to use it as a, our real developer would, which seems like a little tinkering down there and just having a couple things. What programming is a little about on the frame? No, no, it shouldn't be. It should be higher level. It should be conceptual and, you know, coming up with the brilliant ideas and then just, yeah, bring those to reality. Yeah. It's a higher people. Well, I mean, yeah, why don't you put both of those ideas into that paragraph and say, you'll have a look at both of something, if you were to do it. I personally don't want to mess with writing files or anything at the moment. I want to do it superficially. Like the thing that I was thinking there as well is that once it's done for you know one meeting it's done It's there. It's a file text file or XML or whatever it is Yeah, I don't know just it doesn't make any difference really either way to me If it's fast enough on a fly then sure That's both the only issue I have with on the fly Yeah, especially with Java If it's loading the file Yeah, it's always it's just it's just a it's just a full it really So should we all write a letter to that future work as well Yeah, I'm clear to the future work in my section, but I just say that I said what I've done so far and what I'm gonna do Yeah, well maybe some some issues Yeah I like into each You know Sometimes it's easy to have the top it in its own That does make sense, but maybe at the end maybe just a point form of you know things that we're still working on things Yeah, because if you have a discursive thing here and then another discursive thing there Yeah, they're not together you lose a lot of it You Was You Yeah sleep. Yeah. So we're all still writing out. Um, somebody's sending them to you. You send it. Or she'll just take she can take it from now. Or do you want to know? What? I can, yeah, I should have you on a summer. I don't know. Yeah. Okay. Actually, that's a good idea. I'll take one quick look over, try and get it as good as I think that we. Yeah. You stick it together. She'll shine it. Yeah. Yeah. And then send it onto us so that we can nod. Earlier for my little ad. And correct back. And he like things that I thought was wrong in English. What is it? Like no. We're changing dialogue back. Okay. That's good. Yeah. I haven't used my pen. So I was like four lines. Yeah. 1230. Maru with. Oh. Oh. Oh. G. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. 12 days. All right. Yeah. How much will I need you?
