I think I can take notes this time, I guess.  
What?  
I'll take notes.  
I'll make funny drawings.  
Um, actually, I guess first thing I just sort of did a really sort of brief,  
um, yeah, version of what we have to do.  
Yeah.  
Thank you.  
very interesting start of the meeting.  
Yes.  
Okay.  
Yeah.  
I like the timeline.  
Actually, for that, I was just copying the one straight out of the other document, so it's all, whatever.  
Okay, yeah.  
I think that's fine.  
Oh, shit.  
Um, I'm not sure if we need the outline of the prototype. I mean, what what we're going to put into the  
We'll just sort of, well, the thing is, yeah, we're going to be touching on all that during the other part for the progress.  
Yeah, because then that's basically what we're doing here, isn't it? The whole  
Yeah. Well, it was just something that he had mentioned in the um, in the previous, like, just to sort of have a prototype together and sort of just saying that, you know, we could  
potentially do that. It's not something we have to.  
Yeah.  
This could be just some uh a little just just describe some uh screenshots or something.  
Yeah, sure. Like the thing is, I was thinking even the stuff that I was doing, I mean, just throw the screenshots in there when you talk about what you're doing, right?  
Yeah, you can either we can just ignore that.  
Oh, yeah, actually, yeah, that half that at the very end screenshots, but that didn't show up on this page, so that's not even relevant, so.  
Yeah, you can either have, yeah, it says screenshot there and stuff, but you can either have the screenshots by the thing, each one, or um, have just a bunch of them in one section.  
Anyways, so, um, so yeah, this is just very general structure. Um, I guess from this we can just pop in our little blurbs and and uh  
Yeah, I've written the topic segmentation one.  
Right, cool.  
Nice.  
Um, I don't know if there's other stuff that you think should be done to this, I could do that before I mail it to you guys.  
Um, otherwise, Yeah.  
Um, did someone else want to throw together?  
Actually, I can probably still throw it together if you want. Um, put your parts into into this one.  
I think Pinilla should do it, yeah.  
Perfectionist.  
Yeah.  
And I'm being like, I don't know, other meeting speak my language, but. Whatever.  
Um, yeah, well, I mean, it's up to you if you want to keep going with that. I'm happy to do some as well. I have lots of time tonight.  
Um, and then I'll send it to you and  
you can do the final review.  
I'll look at it like when my usual working hours are like from 12:00 till 3:00 or something. I don't know if you can work on that and then always make me feel bad because when I go to bed at like 1:00, you're still online.  
You never go to bed.  
Sleep. You just leave your computer on maybe, you know.  
Pretend always busy, you know, actually not.  
So, maybe, but, um, never online in the morning, so.  
Yeah.  
I noticed that. No one is.  
All right.  
Yeah.  
So,  
Okay. So, I'll send it off to you and uh  
Yeah, do what you want to do with it first, and then I'll I'll look at it.  
sabotage it.  
And I'll send it out to you again.  
Was there anything else we wanted to add to the timeline?  
I mean, essentially, was what like,  
um,  
you can't see either, I guess. Here's the old one.  
Oh, there's more.  
Oh, that's that's the original one.  
Oh, this is the one that Okay.  
Yeah. Which just copied straight out.  
We probably want to think about if we want to change our goals and stuff.  
I think, um, one thing that we could probably skip, uh, totally is the removing things from the audio files.  
That's what I thought as well. I mean, do we are we, are we actually going to attempt that?  
No. I don't think that's that's too big.  
Yeah, I think that's going to be We don't even know how to approach that at the moment.  
It's a good thing to have to say we could what we could have done if we had more time. It's good future work thing, isn't it? Stick it in the conclusion. Yeah. In the final report. Should have we had more time?  
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right. Unless we discover some sort of time warp thing.  
Yeah.  
Yeah, but that's definitely one thing.  
So, maybe, I mean, we we should we should definitely, well, we could probably not put it under this heading, but put it under changes since the initial specification.  
Yeah. And say, you know, we didn't we decided there the time is too short.  
We or we felt there were more important things to do with our time than we prefer to concentrate on the main.
