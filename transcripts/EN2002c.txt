Oops. Does it squeeze in like that? Yeah. Oops. Does it squeeze in like that? Oops. Does it squeeze in like that? Okay. Okay. All right. Do you draw a little comment? Did you guys hear now that I'm talking about you all? Yeah. I'm going to give him a ride. Oh, okay. Excellent. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So how are we getting along? I'm not. One thing that I was wondering is there standard control that you use to connect the different things like you're in the topic and it goes and highlights the topic in the text or whatever. Is there a particular type of control that like is one of these NXT? I think there is. Just because the topic box and all this is based on what was it called? Non-night text area or something? Okay. I think it has some sort of highlighting stuff there. So you should probably look at the... I'm not sure if it's in the update, for example. You haven't had to build any new windows to do that sort of thing like other topics or... Well, we're going to do it for speaker, I guess, and all the rest, right? Well, okay. Can we talk about speaker characterization? How are we accessing the list of speakers? I want to do that actually. They speak on the data processing is fine, but I would not particularly want to do the GUI for it. You don't. Okay. If we want to do that. Yeah, I was thinking about that. I was going to tell me how you want the data presented. Yeah, that. So, it's the moment that there is... I've created two classes. One that our speaker's on represents the meetings. And the information about both is contained within each object. So, and then it writes objects and the objects contain all the information about the meetings and the speakers. So, the speakers that are at the meetings and the amount they speak. And then the average is contained with the speakers. So there's two separate classes. Okay. So, you can write the objects and you can call the objects back. And those returned objects have all the information that they need. And then you can call methods to return whatever you want. Okay. Yeah, I see what you mean. Or everything. But that's why I wanted to know what's the easiest way to have the data. So, I have already calculated the data. I used to pursue that. Yes, basically, okay. That's a good idea. And all stored as objects. So, dot object files. All right. Which means you just would call it... And then you can start to call the load. And you can call it that. And you can create a list of them. Or back to it in a way. And then, or just go to one at a time to pop that window. But that's what I wanted to know. How, how, what format do you want the data to come back in? Because it can come back as... I'm not saying it. Or should it come back as... I'm not saying this. I'll play... When he was talking about like having architecture that things are going to plug into. Yeah. I mean, so the things are all modular. I mean, it would be good idea if we used that same idea for anything else we did. Or what else we're doing. Yeah. Even the searches or whatever. Yeah, you sort of think I mean search results if they're all in a predictable thing with a name. Certain properties or list of properties. Yeah. Yeah. So, um... I can have it so that it returns you a... Is it the moment the main data structures are hash tables for the meetings that say... It's got one that says percent is called percent talk. One percent noise and one is percent participation. Do you see what I mean? So, and then it's got inside. It's got a link... It's got a... It's got the speakers name. And then it's got their percentage for that thing. Oh, yeah. So, it can either come back as a... You can have the hash table. Or you can have it returned as a vector. And it will say noise... It's just a strings noise... X percent. We'll say a vector that's... I don't know, whatever. You can either have... You can either have a like an embedded... A vector array of strings in each one represents one person or whatever. Whatever. What the easiest thing to do. Whatever you give me, I can do it. I mean... Yeah, it's just a matter of deciding what we... What would be easiest. Yeah, you get it. Oh, we're around. Thank you. So, what... Whenever we open a window for one speaker... Yeah. Um... See, that's the... How did we... Can I have a look at that again? If it's in that format... Yeah. It's speaker... Pretty much all of this on. It's speaker... Speakers are the control and... Yeah. They're not... Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So, all of this... All that's calculated as well, all the speaker objects. What was it? Yeah, that's easy. So, I'm quite amusing actually. The influences are... I lived in Germany for six months. I don't know if that had any effect. I spent too much time talking to Brits. That's what some of us are there. They were in these people government rooms. So, then... The all that's calculated as well, all after this. Get the dialog out. So, I don't think that would be difficult. Um... So, then, does this... How is this box populated? Is it populated by the one present or the one highlighted? Then, the one present. The one present. Well, then we could do... Hmm... We could do the one highlighted, I suppose. Because at the moment, I'm using... There are methods that say... For the... For our using for other talk sites, pressing it and it says, like, get... Get talk time. And you... You take the name. So, that... That would call that... Call the meetings method that said the turn out. And that would populate that, which would be an easy thing to do. And easy things. Hmm... Can you say for that? I mean, that would... That would be... Implementing what you said, that you want to see... Per topic you want to see, which one... Spoken most, something like that. So, you could zap through these topics. Meeting. Meeting, sorry. Yeah, yeah. And, um... And it would come up with how much they spoke and you can pick the one that... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that would be easy as well, yeah. So, you know that would be... Yeah, okay. So, I'll just leave in lots of methods that... That would just return one number at a time. Yeah. That would be the easiest way to do it, yeah. Yeah, definitely. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. So, yeah, random things like just... Return, talking time. Yeah. Yeah. Get to it. I think it's really easy. Yeah, really. Good. Yeah. So, each time are you going straight to the XML files for... For the information now? No, it still is an object file. It passes a whole lot of lines. Okay. It's a nice object. Okay. And then, they're much, much smaller. Yeah, it's just one... One K. That's all, just pre-process. Yeah, it's a little bit more... And then, it's just each month, the object's got a return... A bunch of return methods. You have to recreate the object. It's called a load method. Okay. So, what you do is you call a null constructor. Because if you call the proper constructor for each meeting, it goes off and does all the processing and stores a null constructor. Yeah. And then, if you call a null constructor, then you call load, and you can call load on whatever one, or all of them, or anything like that. Because it's a list. Is it for the entire purpose? Or is it just individual ones, like one object for... When I'll do it for each meeting. I won't do it for each meeting. Yeah. Well, they... Yeah. I wonder if they would be useful for some of the other stuff we're doing. Well... Yeah. It just tells you who participated. At the moment, it tells you who participated and the amounts they participated. Okay. In percentages. And in time as well. Can you put in there what topic was spoken about as well? Yeah, yeah. That would be easy. I could use that for the topic pop up in there. Okay. Yeah. So that would be... That would cause a problem with anything that wasn't annotated for topics. That wasn't what? Or just return a null or a blank blank blank blank. No touch-based specified idea. I have a default. There are some defaults that I've been... No, it's actually... You know, a lot of people thank you for that. Because at the moment, if you right click on the topic window, and one of the topics, you have the option of popping open a window, which gives you a list of all the meetings containing that topic. Yeah. Okay. Right. Yeah, that would be a problem. And then you could do a search over the meeting, over the objects. Because that's the thing. These are so small that you can load each... All of the whole lot up and do a search over the whole lot to find who bothers me. Yeah. No problem. Or what topics were in what? Okay. So it doesn't crash the thing. So how would you calculate that? Would you do the summarisation as you populate it? What would be the labels to stick to? Yeah, for the... Yeah, for the... Yeah, for the... Yeah, for the... Yeah, for the... Oh, so that is all stored together. Speak your class and knows about all of that stuff. All right. And the meeting class knows about it. Okay. Sounds good. So have you done these yet? No, no. I don't know. You just got to decide on what we want to... What we want to... I thought the other stuff was more important. Yeah, I didn't think. So it's all usable now. Can I do it tonight? No, design a good first. The problem is if you change the classes, the object serial numbers change and you can't reload the object. So all the processing has to be done over here. And I haven't quite finished it yet. It would become out of sync. And get a bit funny. If I gave you one... If I gave you it now and you worked on it, and then I changed it and ran the thing again, you would never be able to load the objects back up. Oh, I see. And you just need to have multiple copies of objects where you're going to get... Well, let me know when it's sort of usable. But if you want to make the picture, you can do that without anything. What do you mean a picture? Just the... Yeah, but it's not going to take very long to get it. Yeah. Okay. I won't take very long to get it in this part. But I'll need to have done all of this stuff too first. Guess otherwise. I just won't do this thing. So where's that stored in there? That is somewhere under it. On your home directly. Not in there. No, not in there. Wait, it's finished up, but it's going on the way. It will be here. Actually, I cannot upload my stuff as well. I just have to make one change to your file. Just to load this one instead of the default. All right. So it's two lines of code. Yeah. What are you wanting to write that indirectly? Or what do you want to do? What do you mean? If you want to change my code. Well, yeah, just the one thing that's like the action for load and the search thing. Do you want to change that the original and browser file or... Yeah. Well, you're a version of it. Have you done that now? No, I do it in my directory. Oh. Okay, so not the actual one. But a copy of it. I have a copy. Yes. But I will, yeah, I was going to update that one. Just make sense that... Well, just tell me when, because I usually work on my own copy. Right, yeah. And then update. And then update it without checking if the one in the share has changed. Yeah, I haven't made any changes to it yet. Okay. Yeah. You'll just make that one in which you know. Yeah, that you know. Because yeah, like I say, two lines of code. Yeah. Okay, that's nice. And then you can play. There's not much to do. Have to get better results. Like, better. So is that what you're working on now that to... Yeah. To present results myself. And just to wiring the topics in there. Do you want some ways? I mean, the highlighting stuff. Well, also, yeah, like that, that is what I'm saying. Yeah. So I'm just going to find a work on objects that were that... For the other ones. So it goes in in highlights. Yeah. I know. Actually, for an end text area, whatever it is, they... They define some handy highlights on that. So you've got different highlights. You've got... Just look at the... What they wrote about it. They've got like user highlights, selection highlights, time highlights. And... So you know... So you can quite easily... If your text area is called area, you just do area dot, set highlights or something. That's the way I did it to highlight, to cross highlight between topic and... Transpits. Okay. Sounds good. Okay, there's a few more things to do with that. And now, once Penelope gets the index... Then that's going to be kind of fun. I'm just wondering if you had to... Well, the way you're doing it, I was going to ask if the way you were doing it, you were loading like a new corpus each time for each meeting, but you're doing the object. So you don't need to. Just... Because if we do have like the inverted search, says that there's the untimed documents, are we going to have to load each of these ten corp. Corporal. Just to do the individual next to your search. That way it doesn't crash. You try to load or tell him what it crashes. And the peak probably. It's a bit dumb if you can fool it. If you load up ten different engines simultaneously, you can do that. Climb. Really? You can't do them if it thinks they're one. Because they... it's about the amount that each... If you have to kind of call a new class and then it will do it fine. But if you don't... All right, I like how it's more dense and small. Yeah, it says, okay, oh yeah, I've got all this space. You've got yourself. And the way it's it goes, oh no. Okay. It's talked to you now. It's talked to you now. It's talked to you now. It's a nice machine, I think. You've spent too much time. I've got all that. All right, well, I've been doing some random pop-up windows for the speaker characterization, which is good, so feel that in now. Okay. The windows are all there now after lots of feeling. Oh, they're done, are they? Okay. Well, you know, just the pop-up window. They pop up. There's different. Because it basically has to set up like, whatever, 10 pop-up windows in memory, as in already, initialize them. Because there might be 10 speakers. They all have to have different windows. And working on... When you click on a topic to see a list of the topics of the meetings that that topic was mentioned. Okay. And I have a question about the... Said we wanted to start screen. What kind of start screen do we want? I mean, do we want some general blurb about welcome to the browser? One of the more less than a SD browser. Right, so some speech and some music. And a lot of people are like, It's an amazing back-to-long. We have to, you know, while we're debugging. We're getting sick of it. But, you know, or something that just sort of guides them to the most obvious things. Yeah. So do we want... Yeah, maybe we could write and... Or like that, whatever it's called, the top of the window saying, Welcome to the next browser. Yeah. Or a switchboard that comes up that's just a blank form like that with some buttons. Yeah. Load me a meeting, load me a search, load me something else. Yeah. With some achieve. Yeah, but how? I mean, at the moment, the way it is, it's a drop-down menu, as you've seen. Yeah. With all the... And that... And that... Because it's the dialogue class that you use there. Yeah. I'm just going to ask if we should assume that they'll want to load a meeting first, but not necessarily. I guess if we're doing a search on the entire... Yeah. I mean, I think they should have two options. Either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search. Yeah. And for that, once you've got the results, you click on something and now I'm... I think the next thing that you need to do is to have a meeting lady before you start doing any search. Well, we can put the logic in there. You can't... I think we can... The only thing is a nice object model and the only time you get one of those is if you load it in observation. I could probably even... It shouldn't be too hard to put a check in there. And if it has not loaded, then it's important to load one. Yeah. But that's not... You could use the inverted file search to return a list of meetings and then use one of those to load a search. But you won't... Can you not get this non-object? It has to be an observation. And even if you go... You can go and search the whole corpus from that, but you have to have... It has to start with something for some bizarre reason. The engine... There's only one search method to the search engine. The engine class only has one... I suppose we wouldn't want to use... Yeah, we wouldn't want to use NXT at the beginning anyway, because we don't want to search locally. You want to get quite... Yeah, yeah, totally. So... It's a list of no-what meeting it is. Well, yeah. One or then they would open the meeting first, right? Yeah. So let's say they have two options. Either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting that they like. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the things I mean... Just be looking for a word and you know, like it shows up 10 different meetings. Then at that point they'll probably want to... Yeah. So if it don't bite a fault, it goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are returned. I mean, then they'll go through the... But why do we want default? I mean, just... Well, I'd like to load up... Like the thing is, I think... Like when it loads up, it'll load up the transcript window and whatever, the window. Right now, I think just the topic one. Although the time is probably more caused by loading the actual data. I'm just thinking if it's kind of... Like you were saying, you have to have a normal object. Right? I mean, what we do, let's search it all. Yeah, but local search. Yeah. We can't do local search without anything. It doesn't stand on to light up, anyway. We can light it down, but it doesn't have anything. Yeah, but the... Okay, the global one feeds into the local. Yeah, I mean... So if we're getting any usable data, it's going to be doing a search on each of those files. So it's going to be loading up each of those, right at the time, to get the data going on. Yeah, the global inverter file search gives the norm object, basically, to the local search, right? Yeah, right. But it could be time consuming, like if there are 10 documents that... Well, yeah, that's always going to be the case with search. Yeah. And it gives one at a time, anyway, over it. Because it was a precedent. Yeah, well, I'm just thinking of some way we could, you know, cache the results and, you know, nice little fun at the whole... Making things a bit easier. But the thing is, I mean, if we've got that, then it's going to be needing really to load the entire corpus for that meeting. If it's trying to show us where those were, if it's trying to highlight those in the text, transcript, or whatever. And we're going to have to have all that other data in there. So each time when we have a search window, and we have, like, you know, 10 different meetings, you know, the word wireless comes up. Go to meeting one, then it has to reload the norm object. Next one. I mean, that's going to... Yeah, it's not too bad. It's not too slow that thing, it's not too bad on that thing. Okay. That'll be a team watching the volume. It always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least. Like that's all I have to do. Yeah, yeah. And lightly just sort of loading it up, test it, try to manage it, shut down, load it up. Yeah. So just sort of based on that, isn't it? Yeah. But if it doesn't take that long each time, then it should be... All right. I mean, you can... You know, the option is to do a search in the way that... If you do a global search, first, as a first step, only return the meetings. As it... not even the meetings, but the name of the meetings. So, you know, say, you want to search for the word language. Then it gives you as a result all the meetings that contain the word language. And then you can decide, well, I want to search on this and this and this meeting. Yeah, yeah. Or only on this meeting. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Make it strings for as long as possible. And then on your return things, when they actually need to, they have to search. Yeah, they have to search. And that way if they know specifically which meeting it is, they'll save the time. Because I'm sure they don't want to have the extra loading time. Neither if they can avoid it. Definitely. So, yeah. Or they can check my... They can still want to check. Did we think about... Better names for the meetings. Well, I think they were in the text. We can probably do that ourselves and just sort of BDB, you don't just do a... There is, yeah, in one of the papers they have names such as... Oh, do they, do they? Do they even understand anything? Like the work group that it's part of today. One of those. Okay, that's probably just easier. Even better understanding. Yeah. That's a working group. I love that. I want to see the meetings about they even better understand. Yeah. Yeah. Super tech group. So, I've put that in already too. Okay, that's cool. That's sort of. So, yeah, again, concretely to the startup... Startup libraries. We do. So, who would have the... Ideas? I mean, the de-eas. Document Frequency is free to work. Do you actually need the frequencies? Yeah, today, what he's used to be, right? Yeah. Today, it's up at Label. I'll write that, right? Yeah, okay. Yeah, how is that? I mean, do you think you would have time for that as well? Well, I think it's if it's being done. If somebody's done the key, so the idea of... The de-eas already would be... Yeah, not too well. There was a class she was trying to get to work on Friday. They did have all that and it was sort of built in and just had some trouble getting it running properly. But it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff. But it... The class I heard it wasn't working. She was going to look at, you know, more straight-forward sort of thing that really just fulfills what we needed to do. But if we need the... If we do need the frequencies... How do you do any versatile search without the CF idea? I don't know. I think you need that. Well, it would have been like a list of... What did you have idea of standpoints? The amount that they care about in documents, basically. The amount... The F is the document frequencies. The amount that each word occurs... What is it? Term frequencies. The amount that it occurs... One of them is the amount that occurs in each document. And the other one is the amount that it occurs generally. So the more it occurs in specific documents, compared to its general score, the better more informativity is about the same. So the general score would that be... For the whole language? For the whole language? The whole case. The whole date. General frequencies. General one. The class of stoplist, so you remove stuff that it doesn't. Yeah. And then there, which is going to have a... Basically the equals score. So what would the... If we had the... These fake topics, what would they look like? Bunch of keywords. A bunch. Yeah, it's probably easy. Just a list of... Like keywords or something. What's the I and the CF idea in this document? I did do it once, I do have a job of class, it does it for something like that. Because that would be really handy then we can actually test it on the user as opposed to just doing it and not using it. Because if you just have the segmentation that's great but we can't compare it to the hand annotated, you know the hand segmented. And also a keyword gives you an all new type of search, you can do keyword search but you can do keyword search, it could be topics that could make you the same thing. Instead it would just search for keywords and when they tell them that type of search and the topics, perhaps you could search for keyword. Please. I think that would work. I think that would be really nice. I suppose even calculating what's its face is the same thing. The easy bit, it's probably easiest to calculate them based upon in their whole occurrences, in the corpus that it is to calculate them per topic because you don't have to integrate as much. Yeah, definitely. Information. No, you can do search without TFI, if you just can't rank the search. Yeah, that's why I'm thinking to the other. Do we need to? We're just looking at all the things from your stuff, I guess. No, no, that's what the idea was in the first place, rank the results. Sort of, but then the main idea was more like to speed up, speed the search up because NXT over the whole of the corpus, which is not human. But that way it's slowed down, ranking it was slowed down. No, but the general inverted file. It still uses an inverted file, but it ranks the results by the amount that were higher. That would just be nice extra. Yeah, I thought that was part of it, but yeah, okay, it doesn't matter. Yeah, I wasn't sure. We had that in the document. True. No, we did. True. So what is only interim? Yeah, exactly. But yeah, I guess, if that's not part of it, that's it. Yeah, I mean, if you have time. Yeah, basically. Because I'm only going to do this in one time anyways. Because I mean, then it would give you, like if you search for word, it would give you the meetings, but also how often that word occurred and that meeting that would be so useful. We just give you a rank. That was the whole point. Actually, because I mean, this is your top one, this is your bottom. But the thing is we're just looking for when it happens in a meeting, if they're looking for particular term or something, they just want to know if that term exists there, and where does it exist? I want to see it. Yeah, but it will be useful. How informative, that TFI, the F is in informative school. If you have, if you search for language and you return, like, you know, basically all of the meetings, you want to see where they actually spoke about it, where they just mentioned it once. If it's like a two word term, does it TFI DF? It's not a compound noun. It's just two words together. I don't know. Just something like language and... I didn't grow university. Yeah, as a compound noun. Wow. It's like Edinburgh and I... Sunny day. Sunny day. Yeah, I can add it to you. It's my simple form. It would be separate rank for each one, each term. You could make it more complicated and make it... Let's not make it more complicated. And then add those up also in the word. The thing is that the way we were doing it, we were just looking for the words, period, each word in the index. Well, that's the way we were thinking about it. And then it's just saying, were these two words in any of these documents? And then if it was, then we could go closer and do the next research. Yeah. So look for the exact term or the regular expression. I guess you just do some of the individual TFI, the F for each term returned. And that generally will be a bit crude, but it will give you a score. And the higher, the more informative each term is for each thing. It will give you a... It's pretty crude anyway. It's just looking for... It's what it's going to do. It's looking for sex separate... Oh, because then it's going to go into the NXT search and the term... Are we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that? Yeah, that's the... Yeah, that's the... I'm just wondering if it's going to give us something cool. And, you know, absolutely. But if it's sort of like... If the NXT search has still got to be run to find these terms or these... Yeah, these terms. ...drinks and stuff. Yeah, without doing any like... Or also like to wild cards work for something like that. So if you're looking for wireless, wired, wired, blah, blah, blah, you do wire with the star. Yeah, that way. Actually, that's a problem for me too. So... Yeah. Yeah. But the idea is that gives you an informative score or how you combine that is... ...is on to you. I guess there's lots in the list try... It's just work, yeah. If you were... It's a bit of a... There's a whole load about it in Manning & Shoots. We've got a whole chunk about it. So just IR isn't it? Basically, it's pretty much everything. Okay. We've got a big one. A good chapter. Yeah. I've got... Somewhere... PDF. Yeah. 100s of PDF. Yeah. What was... Yeah. Do the PDF, switch it to post-gips, switch it back to PDF. Yeah. Okay. So that's... Okay. I'm not good. Okay. So to come back and start screening... Oh, okay. He's sort of... I'm very unsure about what it actually looked like. I mean, we run it for the part where you can choose the meeting. What kind of information do you want to have about meeting? I mean, the longer name, obviously. If there is one. If there is one. If there is one. If there is one, because they don't all have one more name. What the users at spoke? Users at took part? Yeah. Then that's for me. Yeah. Pretty much the same for the same group. Probably for the most part. I mean, there will be a set of people that do... And that was the best thing. And that was the best thing. Yeah, just to give them an idea, general idea of what there is. And so they can pick a... Search for stuff. Start working. Yeah, I guess that's huge. Okay, like search, browse. Like if you're looking for something specific. Is that what you're thinking? Like if they know exactly where they want to go. They want to go to that meeting on December 3rd. They just want to go there and see stuff. Then they can easily go on browse. Yeah, I want to look at the meeting where it's so-and-so spoke. Yeah. Of that, you know, sort of some sort of research group. I want that first meeting. Look at that. Yeah. Browse by meeting. Browse by law. Browse by speaker. Like, not just in different ways we can do that. Like different buttons on the top. Like if they're looking for particular person, particular working group, particular, whatever. And we could break things down like that. To that level of detail, if you want. Or we could give it more general. Yeah. Because we just want to have a way of, you know, because as soon as they've got loaded their first meeting, they can browse through that quite nicely. Yeah, but I'm just thinking like initially when they load up, what are the range of things that they'd want to do? Yeah. Like if they're part of the next working group, they want to get in there. Do we want to save preferences? What do you mean? Well, if they're part of BDB working group, they're going to want to look at the BDB ones. That's what we default to them. Oh, how are we going to know that? Based on what they did the last time. They can have a site preferences. Yeah. They can have a site-frescent preferences, I guess. But that would defy the whole point of browsing, right? I don't know, you want just to look at all five of them. All right, call it favorites. Yeah. You could have a favorite. Well, you just scroll down the list and find your favorite. Oh, I mean. Yeah, it's not a ventilation. It's not like they come back every day and do the same browsing. Well, it's just every day. I forgot. Well, no, I'm just getting back to sort of what could be on the start-up screen. Like there's just a range of things we could do. We could have search options, browse options. I don't know, just playing around with ideas. And then we can tie this into our evaluation tasks and say, well, if you want to search for a meeting or a search for a user in a particular meeting, then do this. So we can sort of guide them. And it's just like, hey, my task is to do this. And there's a button for it. Perfect. I don't know. Yeah, we quite get it. It has. I was going to put any help in there. Any sort of explanation of how the browser works to be honest. No, that's not what I'm saying. So I'm just saying, like a lot of programs, well, kind of lame programs, do have that sort of thing first, just because I want people to have to go through all the menus and search themselves. And just like do commonly used tasks or just exit and just let me use the program, as well. I don't mean the main thing what you want to do is to view a meeting, right? Probably. Or search, some research. Yeah, research. Yeah. So even if it's just two things, just said one, the one said, take me straight to this meeting and have a text box. You can enter it or drop down maybe. And then another one that said search that allows you to instantly plug out the search. Like find specific meeting. Yeah, that's the new sort of thing. Or one that, yeah, or one. Yeah, that all happens with the search. Yeah. Basically, either the user knows which meeting you want to look at, and you just click on it, or he doesn't, and then you search for one that sort of. Which is crazy. Well, the other thing to do is just have searches the default, just opens and the search window opens. And that's the interface. And you just go from there. Yeah. And then that brings up the browser after you've searched for something. Or the search, but the search window could have on it, something that said just has a drop down menu that says just in a go button that said take me to this. Oh, I see what you mean. So the inside the search window, yeah. Yeah. So the only thing that comes up when you finish is a, when you start, it's just one window like that. And it's got all the search stuff right down there. So this is your search. Mm-hmm. Just all here. And here is just go to wherever. And the go button. And then from there, it takes you to wherever. Yeah, that's what. Yeah. And the topic says welcome to, welcome to our browser. Yeah, that's about right. But I'm unsure of how to, how to put all the information in there. Drop down the menu. But we want all the information about the name, the longer the user. Oh, you want the users. Well, we don't actually have user names do we? Aren't there all these codes? Yeah, it's crazy. Maybe if they know the codes and other, other, other. Yeah, it's too. In case like that, we do want drop down. We don't want them to type them. Yeah. Yeah, drop down. And allow multiple. No, okay, you're just looking for one specific. This is, do you want to search your search? If you want to look for one meeting, just look at it. Yeah, that's okay. Yeah. But then, yeah, as I said, I'll. That's true. Oh, yes, you have two. One, one, one there. But you got to one. I'm meeting one. I'm meeting one. You can choose. You can go for go or go for the other. Don't go for both. No, no, no, no, I'm not. I'm not saying you can pick a user. But you should come up with some list, but an extended list of the, of the meeting. So, you know, you have BDR, whatever it was called. Oh, one. And then it gives you the longer name, blah. And then it gives you the, you know, the participants. We could do Microsoft's, Dali, and hold it over it and it pops up a thing. Oh, I was thinking that. Yeah. But then, yeah. Is that complicated? No, it's not at all, I think. I'm told. I'm told. I'm not trying that yet, but I was going to be. Now it's over, isn't it? Yeah, very good. Yeah, very good. Honestly, that didn't. Yeah, I'm not sure. Is that very, is that not annoying? If you have to. Get out of the bloody way. Yeah, yeah. Yes. I'm just going to say, you know, to search for a specific user, you have to hold your mouse over that one, wait for it to pop up. Yeah, that's the way. But that's why you could just have a list of your users then. And just you just say, I want to look for this user. Go. I mean, if I mean, then it pulls up a list of all the ones who've got that user. And then you search them. And then you do search. Maybe just leave it. Just have them leading names there. And don't worry about the speakers. If they're doing speakers, they're doing search. It's not the same. It's doing a quick action. Yeah. It just be nice to have some basic information on them. Yeah, or you can have a text box there. Yeah, I'm thinking about that updates. Yeah, as you go over the. Then that doesn't get in just like in the way. Yeah, maybe that's the best idea then. Yeah. So you've got to drop down menu. Search, search, but not search. Go. And then some sort of fields which updates stand out, depending on what you've highlighted. Yeah, the full name and the speakers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We can do all of that without even ever going anywhere near loading up there. I think. I think. I think. I think. No meeting a normal. Yeah. Yeah. What is normal? She's. I think it's a night object model. Night. Oh, yeah. I think in our case, it's the right. Coppers. Yeah, is your right. It's the right. Yeah. Yeah. The night right. And then you got night right elements. Got night right. Yeah. You got lots of nom something and then night something and then end something. Yeah, and actually end ones are interfaces and the night one. One of the ways around one is that it's facing ones. Yeah. And then you go back enough. I think what's his name? The API is all right, but there's not a lot of description in it. Yeah. No. And most of the descriptions are hints to each other saying you've got to update this Jonathan. This is an unintelligible. Right. Yeah. So you end up just sitting returns that end text box. Okay. What's that though? An implementation of an end text. Yeah. Interface. What's that? Oh, it's an extended version of it. Oh, it's done. Yeah. Yeah. No, definitely. It's not very fun. Right. So anyone else got anything to say? Not really. Just going to keep on going. Do we, yeah, do we want another meeting at the end of the week with Penelope? Yeah. I mean, I think I'm going to do quite a bit of what this week. So I'll probably want to talk about it. Yeah. I see that one. I think we won't have to have a meeting with Steve on Tuesday or at all. So do we want to arrange this, get this one earlier? If you like. Well, we can discuss that Friday if we have one. That's true. Okay. Friday? Yeah. What time? Just off the SPT. Possibly. I don't know. Usually by then. Need a break. Yeah. That means it's right. I don't know because it's lab and trying to get some work done. Yeah. For the lab stuff. Yeah. I've got a doctor's appointment at 10 to 2. Okay. Right. And. What? Friday morning. Three o'clock. Three o'clock. Are you going to get out? No. Maybe I do. I'm not sure. Okay. She's got a class at 11. We've all got class. Well, three of us have class at 12. How about. So we say three o'clock and then if there's a series of months. We can try one. We could try shortly after. Well, yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah. Well, yeah. Well, yeah. Well, yeah. Well, yeah. Well, yeah. Well, yeah. Well, yeah. Well, yeah. Well, yeah. Well, yeah. What would you want to know? No, probably not. If one's bad for you then. No, no. That would only give us like. Well, what? Spat them. Spat them. How about, like, like, you know, five or six? Three is better than five or six. Yeah. What's three o'clock? Let's say three o'clock. So, three o'clock is a problem, five or six will be a problem. Cause I might be here. But I don't think that will be not sure. All right. All right. I'll write this meeting up and I'll send it to Pemir as well. Okay. Is she collecting them? No. You're just sending it to her. Because she's not here. I mean, is she collecting? Oh, right. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Yeah. It's cool for you. I collect meeting something. I don't know if somebody was collecting them. Well, that's what I thought when you did that. No, we should probably do that at the end of the year. Yeah. Then we'd know who's missing more. So, can we just repeat briefly what we've spoken about? So we've done a progress on the speaker characterization. Yeah. Who does the speaker characterization? We mentioned topic labeling with keywords. Yeah. We discussed if the search should be ranked. And Michael, did you have anything else? Yeah. Yeah. That's right. I think I had a question. I don't know. I don't know. I've never seen a question. There's just sort of the basic implementation stuff that I was running about. I should be fine. It's just progressing. Did we decide whether to be ranked? No? For now, I... Oh, well, basically not. Not unless you've got time for it at the end. Yeah. Well, I think you would complicate things quite a bit and not bring us a lot. in the words for a particular document. It's not really getting them together. Like if someone's looking for a particular term, I don't know, just don't know if it would bring us that much. I think it would. Also. I think it would give you the most relevant result. If they're looking for like I say, sunny day, and you know, sunny shows up in this document, day shows up, but they're not together. Or if they are together. I don't know, it just doesn't, you're looking for that term. And relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up, it shows up. No, but for things like if you search for language, then you might have, you have some topics which have as a, you know, some, some meetings which have, as a topic, language, they specifically speak about language. And they use that word like in every sentence. And then you've got those that just mentioned, you know, mentioned it briefly, like ones or twice saying, you know, my language is German or something stupid that you don't even want. So you want to distinguish those somehow. Or nice anyway. Yeah, that would, in the sense for single words, it would be very useful. For multiple terms, unless you want to do something, there will be a way of doing it for multiple terms. For multiple terms, we can just do something really simple. I mean, or you could do it and override it by the, you could just ignore the ranking if it doesn't show up together. Yeah. Or you could, have you penalized it, you could just put a way to do the search, just still do the NXT search then. Yeah, you do the NXT search, it doesn't sound together. Either disregard it or put a way to you against it. Yeah, so how many pairs you can go and wouldn't show up on the search results if you're just picked it makes sense. So then just next. Just disregard it. Yeah, I mean, you just do it really simply, you know. You'll have the results I told you. We'll have to talk to Prano about this. Yeah, yeah. See how she's doing this. We are using that. I mean, it does make sense for that. But, yeah, there's actually, yeah. It doesn't have to be your intelligent. Yeah, because something's going to get a lot of results. Yeah. And if the one that you got just happened to be at the bottom, and it was actually the most relevant one, something that I was also. I mean, if it's, well, yeah. Yeah, okay, search me. And then we could actually put that like on the list of meetings that get returned if there were 15 meetings of languages in. It's going to show you. So, yeah. Rank them as to which is the one. This is the one. So, okay. Let's see that. And also, with something like sunny day, the, if sunny and day aren't mentioned together a lot, but sunny tapas, once, it's term will be low and will push down the other one. If you combine them, if you just add them together. Well, the things I mean, that'll be exactly how we're doing it now. Like we're just looking for the two words separately. See if they exist in the same document. If they do them, there's possibility that they occur together. And then we do the annexes research on that document. Yeah, yeah. But you have no ranking system at the moment. So if something's an amazing, highly ranked thing from Tehran, I think it could just be ignored because it falls off the bottom of the, do you, I can assume you only have, you have a, do you, you return all results for all, say you type language and it returns 75 meetings. Or rate balance, starting, I don't know. I don't know what it's doing. What was not that amazing? But yeah. Yeah, there are these things. But there are 75 meetings. Is there really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, if you return 75, where do you stop? How do you rank them or something? Or it has 20, even if it's has 20, do you cut it off at 10? Yeah, I'm the rank number. Yeah, that's true. OK. What's the threshold to rank them? No, it's true. Look at three tomorrow. See the more we, it would be useful as well for a word like language that might occur in all of them. But you want to find the one that actually contains it useful somehow. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You know, you still want to be able to search for the word language in a sensible way. Yeah. Well, we'll discuss it again on Friday. Yeah. Is that it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Back. All right. Yeah. He probably got a different problem. Yes.
