Who was this person? How do you get home? Back to my home! I've already doed home. What is that? Like this? Oh, it's stuck. Oh, yeah. Ah, that's sabotage. Okay. Keep an eye if I'm dropping. As I said, it doesn't seem very... I'm gonna stay there. It seems slippery. Perhaps, maybe I said you... This... Are they on yet? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Who wants to? What's that? No, that's just summer. No. Oh, right this one. Have you changed the target? I was trying to... I didn't have privileges to get in to update your file. Yeah. I actually meant to send the mail and then I was just kidding. No, when you said it, beginning I thought, must check the lead right in the nose. Yeah, because I forget mine as well. It's just like every time I put something in there. So yeah, that was the main thing. As soon as I'd say it will be ready. I was making a couple of little changes. So those will be able to play with. I'm working on the... Trying to get the topics in summary search implemented as well. So that's sort of tonight. Yeah. Getting a better feel for all these night objects. It seems a little chaos. Yeah. I know, if you're gonna use this stuff later on in your life then you spend the time to invest and learn all about them. And it's like, what's the minimum I can get away with? Yeah, yeah. Get me what we need. Unless I want to do something with this in the future. Is this your project? Yeah, it's your future. Anyways, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. There is a file in the directory called Disful. I sent Excel. I think that's the... I saw that and I'm just trying to remember if I did create it. I think I was... Because I was trying some stuff a couple weeks ago. So that may be mine. It doesn't have anything in it. Oh really? It does. It has about three lines of XML. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, because I saw it again today. It was just... Yeah, that was... I'll move that just to make sure... It just needs to be occupied if I see it right. It's not needed. Give me some questions of what's happened. It's a big spoiler. I had lots of stuff in there yesterday. Yeah. I just... I was on chat. I know they lived there, but there's even more stuff there. I was unzipping all these kind of crazy huge things that were in the wall. I needed them. They were for this stuff. It's all right. That's what I'm calling on that one. What did you actually do in our house? I used to use. So we probably won't have to wear them. Should run the item. Yeah, yeah. There's about eight gigs on this. It's just much bigger than all of our home, though. Yeah. It's like, well, see if you do. Thank you. How's everything else going? Has anyone had time to play with it? Yeah. I had to play with it. Yes, Dave? Comments? No, it was good, really. Yeah, I like to. I'm. Generated of exceptions in the background. Oh, yeah. Actually, it didn't cause any problems, but it just... Do we want to keep that? Like, are we keeping that? How that happens? It just prints everything out in the shell as well. Like, as it does everything. It just kind of... I guess that's its default behavior anyway. My smile. Yeah, I mean... Doesn't really do anything. The thing is that, yeah, there is, as I said, a while ago, there's still this one era, which is bugging. I think it's the next two. Oh, right. That always generates these. I think when you... When you... That click or like, click or something, I can't remember now. But if it's a real era, then it stops. So it can't be... Yeah, I didn't discover any of those. I did have a little... It's a good thing. I've probably not it to see if it'd break. That didn't break too. I didn't play that long, but... It seemed alright, really. And the start-ups screen, it's quite good. It looks alright. Yeah. I was more or less just playing with the things that I had to do directly with what I was doing. So I didn't take it for a full test drive out, but I could do that. Yeah, we did. Is there any comments you have about just like wording and things like more or things? No, it looks alright. The only thing... The start-ups screen is not too pretty, but then... Yeah, I do. ...that's not a lot of this job. At the moment, as well, the whole windows at pop-hop are not pretty tall, but I would make them a bit nicer if I had more time back than that. You look like that. No, it's not. It's not a top priority. The window manager might look a little bit nicer. Yeah, I think it'll look better on windows as well. I see. Because Java uses the native windows, doesn't it? Actually, can we run it on windows? That took me so long to close the start. Did it? I'm quite glad that it looks nice on one run all this time. Were you using like a GUI builder or just off-hand board? No, this is just... Yeah. Okay, that's... Yeah. That's nice. Well, the... The speed characterization is finished. Right? I haven't updated all those object files yet, because it takes ages on it and it's in pieces. It's faster for some bizarre reason. If I log in at home and then run the code, it runs it much faster than if I do it here. Wait, that's... I just can't have to sit in the lab and wait half an hour. You can connect to your home machine from here and then start it from there. I've done some like double-porks. It's insane. It really is video. Try that for me. Yeah, I started using your... The speed... I don't know if you've seen that in the video. So it tells you what speakers are in which meeting and then you can see which topics... Yeah, something like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's good. Your sound is really good. It's got a good interface and it's used. Nice. Yeah. The dialogue acts are all done. An air card, I'm using something. But some of them... The thing, actually, what I wanted to talk about dialogue acts was... There are some that occur all the time that I just... And I don't know how interesting there are. So the first one statement is that... I removed it because everything is prefixed by a statement. Every single dialogue acts with statement. And so everybody's top dialogue statement. So I go into that. And then everybody... The next one seems to mostly be back channel. I don't know what that means. Who knows? What was it? Back channel. Is that what that means? Oh, I'll keep that then. And then the others... I don't know, it's boring. Exactly. Some people don't know. There are some people who don't do that. Actually, yeah, you can see that they don't do that. And there's the bottom of their list. They're sleep-offing. And some people have... And the knowledge one is a big one that comes up all the time. Yes, no questions. Well... So which... You know, suggest... Maybe you can suggest a few that which would be interesting to you less. Well, that's the thing I wanted to know whether or not we... Because at the moment you can get... There's a method that will just give you the top five for... Or the top X, you give it in number and it will give you the top whatever. Right. For each person. And then each meeting knows about all the different dialogues for each person in the meeting. And then mount that that occurred. And we'll give you that in top order as well. Or we'll give you... Or you can just search for each specific dialogue that... But you have to search on in these encays rather than... Real words, I don't know how to say that. So I don't know what we want to display, that's what I mean. I don't know if we have like a choice so they can filter those out. The top most common, just say okay. Show all or show. You know, only... All the lines. All the lines, all the lines, 25. But... Dialogues. I don't know, yeah, it doesn't really matter. I think it would be difficult. But it would be difficult if... In the speaker characterization window we had a heading top five dialogue acts. And then a little brackets but they're not actually the top five but top five minus the most common ones which are... Yeah, boring. I think we should have the global top five because each speaker's got a top whatever. And so just say one of the boxes just explains to us this is my top five dialogue acts. For the speaker. For the speaker. In the meeting you have what you could either have the most commonly occurring ones or you could have a list of each speaker's top dialogue acts. Either of those would do you but it would start to think about what the space is you have in there. No, I wouldn't. Yeah. Well you could have no, you don't need that. Because it's a speaker window. The speaker characterization window comes up. Exactly. So you've got the global one there and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting. Yeah. And then the top five in that meeting in global top five this meeting and then the rest is obvious. Yeah, just do top five both local and global. And then have another. But then we want a selection of three or four maybe interesting ones. Okay. And then. But some often the interesting ones don't occur things like joke, but okay very often. Well they do sometimes but they're not that common. One guy has top five joke one of his jokeies and under that. I follow this. Yeah. This is good for browsing now. It's perfect. I mean that's true. It's exactly what you wanted to do. And then you have these things. Yeah. Yeah. So you could take it. Yeah. Exactly. I'm all interested in this guy because he sees you. So I would give me. Yeah. Yeah. It's taking to next joke. Yeah. That would be quite good. So is this percentage then? If you say like joke for this speaker is percentage 20. Yeah. Is that the what percentage of his speech is joke or what percentage of the dialogue that he makes our jokes in the meeting and globally separately. Yeah. So one. Okay. Yeah. I think most things are coded with the dialogue act. A lot of them are coded with Z which means low label. So I just ignored that. Yeah. Says boring. And statement which is boring. And also the other thing that they have is if somebody quotes something. So if I quote a joke to you, they separate that so they put the dialogue act and they put a double a colon and they put that. So I just ignored any any quite in material because it's not a real joke anyway. Yeah. Somebody else is joking. So you have to be original about in particular. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's one. So that's sort of complimented now or is that the first one? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just finished. They might be simply saying. But I think it's pretty much completely. So I'll do that tonight. Just put it up and as he can start using it. When I have to type in, I'll just recompile the embroser and then just get that. You will. Yeah. Well, so it will use as my part as well. Yeah. The insertion. Actually, do we have naming convention for our source files? Just prefix them with an admin. Yeah. I was thinking that sort of turned out that way. Yeah. Yeah. That's sort of what I was doing. Like for your stuff, do you have? I just know it's called mating and speaking. Okay. Well, I can say, you want to defend those lines. No, it doesn't matter at this point. Yeah. Just curious. I think about future stuff maybe. You can put it in a packet. Yeah, that's true too. You can be bothered. Yeah. Doesn't matter. Well, it doesn't seem to be any different. I've never ever used double packages. Yeah. It's not the same direction. It works. Sorry. I have one question that I reckon we should have a little icon on the bottom of it. You can double click on it. Well, no. I know. I know. Yeah, that's what I like. I've got an X which is an XT and it's sort of a bit cheeky to use that. Yeah, it will have something else. Just for a little Microsoft gift. No. Not something original. What do you suggest? The only thing I could think of was an M. Yeah, I know. Same here. We have a big yellow ending. What about seeing that before? It'd be soo good for that. Supercise you can go. Yeah. Come on. Yeah, that would be good. Just probably a basic text font. Just something nice. Something solid maybe. Anything in it. I mean, there's tiny so we can't really put more than one character. Anybody have any artistic talent? No. Do you think you've been doing MSC's and information? Yeah. It's possible. Something for a talent. Yeah. Well, I've done some balance here. Yeah. We all check. We check and find out. Well, if you find anything, then send it to me. Okay. Otherwise, I'll make up some M. How do you add that to the Java program? This is just basically the whole thing. I'm not sure if it is. It's really easy. You do it in one of the, whatever the main window is, you set gear for some set, set, set, set, pitch, or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, yeah, I know how to put it in frame. I just have to put it in frame. Okay. I have to import it somehow more questions. Okay. I think you just keep it a thumb and you need to keep it in mind. Yeah. It's also a little to the automatic scratching down. Yeah, yeah. Just digs it in the comments. We have to remember to include that in our evaluation. How did the improve your browsing experience improve? Yeah. They know it's a distinctive experience, I guess. They could even have some sound when it comes on. They did it. Welcome to the meeting. Can we get sound on these machines? No. I have to do it. Have you ever managed? Oh, yeah, you must. Yeah. Plenty sort of music on those dice machines. No, right. Okay. No, but I think if you find it, it'll just play. It'll just play. All right. Great. If the sound card is registered to your name, which usually is not. Yeah. And you have to reboot. Sometimes it still doesn't work. Right. Sometimes it works. I guess that's why we have a separate speech lab. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of audio. Okay. Okay. Okay. All this. Yeah. I'm running some troubles with the indexing, but another package. Right. Instead of writing it from scratch, because I don't know. Just now, but I haven't played around it much. But we'll see what happens in the next days. Are we going to be trying to get the output from that? I don't know. Still have been found out if it's feasible to open up more than one. Yeah. Yeah. As many non-objects as we can for each meeting. Like we were going to figure that the ranking did make sense. Like, to be looking through the highest ranked ones, first. So if we are going to look thrown in five, but I'm just pick the top five to do that. The search. Seems I'm doing. Probably. What we're looking for. Any ways. It gives me to write. I know. I still can't make it from TNT from Jom. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can make it well Yeah, that'd be surprised because I'm bad job Feels like it's a job I didn't just find the documentation for an extended run I mean sometimes I have methods that don't have any explanation to at all Yeah, yeah, I think it was like right I'll try this then and see what it actually means It's been spainly generated by going to generate Java doc and just went And they never put it to it Well, it's still just research It's least good to know what methods are there without having to look at the source Did we have a date for when we actually want the system done today? Wasn't it Because the thing is I mean we can keep working on little things So I know do we want to set an actual hard deadline or When exactly where we're gonna start evaluation? Well, that's the problem because Yeah, I guess what we can look at like test cases or whatever That sort of thing I mean that's fairly straight probably Yeah, we had the deadline us Friday, but we won't be able to do any evaluation during the weekend So I think we could set Monday Yeah And that would give us a lot of time to do this Yeah, you can try it We're kind of just going to do it But I've got my DNLG present day on this Too much now But yeah Monday We're trying to do Monday I mean we could Showing my love Monday We'll probably have to talk to Steve at some point We'll just have our regular Tuesday meeting with him Like we could send him an email, but I don't know if you do that Yeah, just she's on a Monday this week I think that's why we did enough of the meeting Maybe it's just today Send him any many, maybe we'll be reading any Asked Although do we really want the answer? Yeah So if we don't ask and we can push it off But at the end we'll say You know you never gave us any tests So he's supposed to give us tests Well, it's not about how I'm He said he would try He would make something up Okay, yeah, find some people There's how I'm doing today Yeah, yeah, that's The thing is, you know, because we're going to email Laura and I see We're looking for volunteers Yeah I think if we don't get anything from him Then we should just do all Friends If they have time Start fighting people Well, they're going to you What are your friends? They're going to need us Yeah, I know, but They're going to need us They're going to need us Yeah, I know, but They're going to take on Yeah, that's true They're going to be half an hour Yeah They can use each other Yeah, actually some other friends of mine Different programs might be more willing Have more of a break So that might be a good idea Get a range of types of people as well Like not highly Well, they will be You know, Linux literate They're going to have to do that Yeah, I think that might be good as well So the wider range of people So how many people do we need to try and I don't think like three or four Yeah, that would be good I think you know like ten No, let's say forever And then you go analyze the results That's the thing that we did And we did it all together And it's just, let's put these There's three people Yeah, that was fine Then you can do a massive amount of analysis Some three people Really? Yeah, yeah Oh yeah I can get range of people if you have three Yeah, one can be as I said One dude of the three And I won't suppose to be a woman And there's going to be a man And there should just have two Yeah, my bad one was a weird one Yeah, you're boring Oh my god But yeah, if you find some, then that's cool If it lines with people And another thing Oh, great We have the presentation on like in one and a half weeks or something Whatever, you have nearly two weeks Yeah, it's two weeks Oh wait, two weeks Yeah, it's two weeks then I have to have done the evaluation by then Yeah That's what I'm saying I thought the evaluation maybe for the report So that's the report on the 25th, 25th Is that the study? That's what I understood Yeah, that's the study I thought you said 25, even though it's good Friday Yeah, it's not good Friday Yeah, it's good Friday Oh yeah, he's true to this Wow, not a good Friday No, no I'm sure on the website he says Thursday Yeah, okay Okay So that gives us two days to do the The report No evaluation Well, you know, the question is, do we need the evaluation for the presentation? I didn't think so necessarily I wouldn't assume, but we should ask him We should definitely ask him Because if not, then We should try and have it done by then Otherwise, it will start to be game Yeah, that's probably tight otherwise It's a good target Yeah, you might be right We should aim to be finished by Monday, this Monday coming But we know, yeah, well basically for Tuesday Start the evaluation It's probably much straightaway Yeah, yeah Yeah, and then get Because we need the right presentation as well We're still right in the report And everything that's the right is fun And then we're still going to finish by Monday Because after Monday, I'm pretty much free for about a week or so Exactly, that's the point It's like, if we had, yeah, a bit more time Yeah, well I'm not free after this Monday, but I'm pretty light Oh, the next one Okay, yeah, I'm free this after this Monday We? Well, what do you want to do? That's easy compared to me I mean, I'm not even worried about that Because I don't have anything after the accident And the Emasavio research proposal Well, that's in on 18 Is that in on the 18? Did you know that's you? I was yours No, that's all we had So in our timeline, we were within 25th And that's the Friday, yes Maybe that was us then, not him Yeah, that's why I'm trying to find his date That's why I'm trying Yeah, Thursday 24 Depending on how we're partying on the 24th Yeah Well, now you can End of lectures So So 24th, so, we... Anyone fancy writing in any mail? Oh, it's actually 24th Just to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration? Or... That, yep We should have it done anyways, but okay, that's true Hopefully, but... Is that a part of the demonstration? Did they want that information? Yeah, yeah, yeah I mean, we need to know that anyway to prepare the presentation And... What is the other one? Basically How is it going with your evaluation before the... People we had for us What you think and when Did he say anything about like what he expects Of the final report and stuff like A few little things, um, just made some comments the last meeting Just general, like how it all integrates blah blah blah Let me know Did he ever say how long it was supposed to be? No, I'd expect some of my 10 to 15 pages I mean, how long were... Although it's 50% of the mark I think I think But we can write a lot, I mean, I think we should write everything Exactly But we have a bit of time to do that Because this... I mean... We have interim report of seven pages And that's... we can... Seven pages? Yeah, we could probably just expand that I mean, because I mean, a lot of it's going to be the same thing Find two under detailed And then, I mean, write about devolation That's going to be quite a bit... Yeah, that could be... that could easily be like the other sub-precious I don't think Yeah, it's just going to be So you want to write me an email then? Sure And when I get home today, which will be before... Before I pass six, I will make that far readable, right? Oh yeah, sure No big rush Although just together, all the ways I'm trying to remember to do that to my... Well, I will need your snippets of code Or if it could, if I had them by tomorrow evening Yeah Oh, I was going to ask... At the moment, you're searching, wouldn't you? How is it organized? Just basic... pretty much like the interim... Do you want to get the interim stuff? Just sort of like Google type thing and just... At the beginning, when you haven't searched yet, Is it just... is it still divided into two And the bottom half is just... Yeah Just empty Okay And as these come on, there's probably... And then, if you... I don't know, double click on one It doesn't do anything yet, like that's the other big part I mean, how to get that communication between the two different kinds of people Because the thing is, if we have different things in here, like transcripts, Which is somewhere in this versus the topic Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah That was why I was sort of deciding to get the three panes in there And so then just the one Yeah, so there's a couple of those little things Well, it's the icon by the way Yeah, again Beautiful, yeah, it makes more sense Yeah, maybe you want to do left hand... Yeah, one left, like highlights the result in whatever you've got open Is that how it works in the other ones? In like the other windows, like the various like... Yeah, usually one left, like it's highlights it, of course highlights everything I think, yeah If you have like a particular window that you want me to mimic, its behavior, then like just find it in the program And just say, okay, just how this one does it So if it's like the topic window or whatever... So like just sort of trace back and figure out what objects they're bringing into you And still be good Because the transcription window does cross-highlighting In a very awkward way Because it has to find the topic first That was a pain And when you right click on a topic, it pops open the list of meeting with that container, that pop... ...popic And that works when you left double-click on a topic... Oh, on a meeting, sorry, then it loads it So you could take that for loading So if we have that the same on this one at this that you, if you double-click, then it loads So one left click just highlights Highlights, yeah, I mean obviously highlights whatever you've clicked on here Oh just the item, but also highlights The transcription, whatever it is But she's difficult because... You don't really ever have one meeting open and those results will be of... Well I suppose if you have a local search, then it could cross-highlight Yeah, this should be possible Because you know, if you get back several different meetings here... And even if you have one meeting like in the, you can't cross-high anything Although, yeah, this will, this is actually different from how we printed up here Like if we're doing a global search, then we are going to do it like how we said before... ...pop up a list of the various meetings that found those terms And then we'll add our multi-select or choose the one we want to actually do this I think multi-select would make a lot of sense Well just if there's like three of the top meetings, like we said before language We'll look at a little more language and get the highest rating on Actually look for the terms we're not loading it out of all 76 So the results from that will, you know, narrow down what we're going to use for the local search And we'll just do the local search on those ones that are chosen So it will be a bit different from how that is right now When we do the full search at least In any case, if you left click on a result that is contained in the meeting that is currently open It should cross-highlight if not be counted It should be very simple to just get the topics and summaries Using that text extractor, thinking you are a cry Yeah, you have to start getting the topics out instead of the segments Can you make a thumbnail part? Is it very difficult to make another gooey but only for a global search? So that we search two different ways Just take that away the local checkbox So it's time for the start-up? Really? Yeah, because in the start-up screen you can't have it Yeah, local anyways, yeah, no, that's easy Yeah, you can do it like that That would be pretty handy Everything else can just stay the same You can just leave everything as it is and just remove the checkbox You can be able to do a global search for topics Yeah, that was quite like, yeah, if I make a just index Yeah, yeah, I did think about that way What? I mean, yeah, that was an amazing thing It's not first priority, maybe Are we bothering with our topic stuff? So, what was that sort of like our own topic segment? Like since we can't do the labeling and all of us We are still doing our topic segment Well, we're not doing anything We're not doing anything But we're not going to be very least We won't be doing a global search on the topics for our topics Since they don't have labels No, they don't All the label ones? Yeah, label twos Okay, yeah Even if I happen to manage to make it do some keywords I don't think we can expect new tools So, come up with this thing Well, no, I would be kind of straightforward If you're creating actual files Yeah, if I create a XML files I'm not going to do that I did have a look at trying to create a XML files And it did look like a mission It's not, it's a straightforwardness writing in it But it's organising the segment later It just looks so complicated Get it from The, um, from a plain text file Back into organising by who, which speaker speaks what And how, doing the segment I think that was the stupidest way They could have ever progressed the whole thing If you ask me, I think Organise it by time, not by speaker But So I don't know Okay, yeah, are we done? Yeah, I guess we just see what Steve says About the real variation And then like Or keep it touch by your mouth We need Anything, I guess we'll see in terms of And mumble Yes Yeah, we thought we need another meeting this week Probably not, I mean Just get work I think that's what I've got to do We can just email if we need Yeah I guess Okay Hey Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm
