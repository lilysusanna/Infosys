Help. Help. Is that fair? Um, let's raise that. No, no really too hard. I don't like it. Okay. I don't like it. Okay. Right. Okay. Um, right. Okay. Um, and then I'll give it a little bit. Um, right. I'll agenda for today. Do you want to give me a second? Uh, no, that's okay. So, um, I'll go over what was made of that. I'll give you a last. Okay. Um, we've signed upon a universal control. One hand that for all to be prepared. Um, that it was important that the project that built a wide range of consumers, wide age range, not limited to anyone, was signed with the important to reflect the company's image and aspect, with the fashion and electronics and the fact that it's thin. Um, our budget would have to affect, um, try not to reflect our budget, um, that we might have a bit of, oh, I'm confused. I think. Um, dissonance between what our budget was and what we wanted to look like. Um, wanted to look unflattered, undone to the customer, we discussed a flip over design, um, reducing the size of control and an electronic panel, um, the further features that the programming and things like that. Okay. Um, three presentations. I've got right here. So, should we give them my fingers? Um, is it okay if I just want that to later? I just want to get access to a little bit more information. Is that okay? Okay, yeah, I'll go first. Can I grab the... It's like me. Thanks. Um, what does press OFA? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is, uh, the working design presents by me, the, uh, industrial design and student math. Okay. This is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint, so. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint, so. What, the first thing question I asked is, what are we trying to design? Well, a device which basically just sends the signal to the TV to change its say, whether that be the power or the channel. Um, or the volume, everything is just, um, some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliances, sending the signal to. Um, so I decided I'd have a look at what other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that. But, uh, although we will want to be taking ideas from other people, we want to make sure that our design stands out. And I thought that was something that, well, it wasn't really my area because I'm dealing with the inside, really. Yeah, I ran out of time, so I can do this one. It's fun as the last time. Um, and, uh, I found out that most, uh, controls use some form of infrared signals to the TV, presumably because of the cost issue of, uh, something like, uh, the same thing that can be used wireless, and you don't need to send very much information. Um, most of them are powered by some form of battery. Now, R1, I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A batteries, but those can be quite bulky. So I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else, um, so we could shrink down the size of the control. Can I interject to ask a question? Yes, you're right. You think the triple A batteries are small or the character? Um, no, no. If you look at, if you look at most remote controls, they're quite, they're quite chunky, and that's because of the size of the batteries. They have to be, obviously, this certain size to fit those batteries in. Triple A's are the smaller sugar. Yeah, well, you can get the sort of circular round ones, but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the, the, the they should cross, um, and which leads sort of on to the next point about being small and easy to carry around. Um, now the ones are the moment are small, but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller. Now, the main components I came up with, um, were obviously the power source for the batteries, because otherwise it's not going to work. Uh, as I said about the, of which batteries we were going to choose, we can discuss that later. And then obviously you need something to decode the information that you're putting in from, from the controller and to turn it into an infrared signal, which we're going to use to send the information. Now, these have a wireless range, up to about five meters, which is so suitable for anyone who's watching their TV and less than in a cinema, which not most people do say, as we're applying to the most audience, that should be fine. And then I was, uh, just had a quick look at the X-Tammel design, but I, I left that mostly to the, uh, interface designer. And so this is what I had, as the basic idea of the what we want to do, it's not a proper circuit. I'm not sure if it'll work or not. I'm not even confident with those, the real, um, the real way you'd wire out. But anyway, we've just got the, the power going to, the infrared bulb, the chip, and the, uh, UI interface. Um, which would basically, when you, when you pressed anything, it would, the chip would convert it into some form of our data, which, um, which could be decoded by the TV receiver, which obviously means that we're going to have to conform to whatever, um, whatever form of communication that the TVs are already using, and since that, that's another reason to use, uh, infrared, because that's what all TVs use in the world. And then finally, um, we want, uh, the, it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost. So all the components that I've put forward are, uh, low in costs. So that should be good. Um, it should, it should be different enough, um, from the alternative products to get good consumer base. We're talking about it before. And also just something that I was thinking about, uh, because they're small. They're also easy to lose. So if we could look into some way of, you know, some anti going down the side of the sofa, um, thing that you could have, I, that was just sort of a general point there. That's a very important point. It came up in our market research findings too. So I can refer to that. All right, okay. And yeah, that's, that's what I came up with there. Okay. Um, would you like to come to your room for a moment? Yeah. Um, uh, okay. Okay. Just to be fair, um, uh, uh, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, uh, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um,
