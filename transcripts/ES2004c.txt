I'll wait until you're all in. I'll wait until you're all in. First, finally I'm ready to spray my kotatsu on. Okay? â€“ Welcome back everybody. I hope you had fun. Right, this is our conceptual development team. I think we're starting to head over ourselves from the last meeting. Yeah, I was getting the impression as well. This is where we talk about Prov2's materials, user interface, and trend watching. So I think we've touched on a few things to be left already, but we'll just go over it. The minutes from last time, we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext. It wasn't going to be a control for everything, and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it. We have decided on leaving out the voice recognition. We've decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. We were thinking a show, but something along this side, just a different shape from what's normal. You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries, and we were going to think about the port and alarm for getting it off, things like that. And our market was going to be young business kind of range. So she was starting with the first presentation. Yes, I hate you. Just connect up. Thank you. Okay, so we decided on our market, and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching. The methods we used to decide on current trends and so on, market trends, were that we did our traditional, our usual market research study with our 100 subjects. And the general feedback from them is that the most, I'm sorry, I'm slightly tongue tied after lunch. We decided on the most important aspect required in an remote control device and we'll come to that later. So that was one of the first things we did. Also with our company being full-runners in putting fashion into technology, we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan. So the general findings from that was that in the market trends, the most important aspects for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel rather than the current functional looking feel of remote controls. They also want a remote control to be technologically innovative. And of course, as we predicted, it should be easy to use. Now I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel, is the most important, as twice as important as the second, technologically innovative, which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use. So possibly the feature that we put first is actually third. It's still important, but it's third in order of preference for the subject that we looked at. Okay. Now the fashion update, which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group, we found from our consultants in Paris and Milan who attended all the designing fashion fears, then, but fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too? There also seems to be a trend towards a spongy field to materials, again, in contrast to last year. So a lot of interesting feedback. They're both in our market research department and from our people in Paris and Milan. We're interesting to see what our design people make of that. Okay, thank you very much. Let's start from inside and work our way out. Yep, okay. Unless anyone has any questions about that? Okay. Yes. I hate those better things. I wish they could do them on too tight and you can't get the new furniture on them to undo them. Okay. This is all about the design of the edge components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment. Okay. First, into the method, the main idea of the whole thing is just so you just press buttons and it should activate things on the TV and we discussed last meeting it should be easy to find. Also, in this study, I've looked into the availability of some of the materials because some of the things that we looked at last time aren't unfortunately aren't available. Findings, I've got my nice little picture there. This is the chip called the TA-W1A35 which is what's used in pretty much every remote control because it sends out standard signals based on your input and it's pretty much used for all TV remotes at the moment. And then we're looking into battery options. There's actually no rechargeable option available. So I saw the standard AA and AAA which we thought were a bit too bulky and then dynamo charging. I thought that might be a bit silly to be honest. It's basically like wind up radio. So you wind up your remote control before you use it? How long can you get out of that? Can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night? Yeah, I presume you wouldn't have to wind it for very long but I don't think it's really necessary when you think of the next two options like the solar charging because most people have the light on in the room anyway. So they could get when you got to do it. So the light charge is a somewhat of a distance? No, it's not. It's a bit... Regarding the sizes, which one you think will be like because we have to take into consideration size also. So maybe standard AAA might take less space or dynamo might take more space. Yeah, it would. The dynamo would take more space because you don't actually need a physical, so it would handle to wind up. I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun. Yeah, I don't think it can. It's artificially light and I don't know. But I mean, that's not many... You don't want to limit your market. I mean, people who live in basements like there's not that many people. I know, but there are so many people. If we're at a marketing international, I think that's right. Yeah, and most people, most people all say watch TV in the night anyway. But then it would be charging to the day. I think the point is, it charges to the day. And then you've got it charged. But I think the next one's the best anyway. The kinetic charging, which is like you get it in wristwatches. Yeah, and you don't even notice it. I mean, the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would charge it up. I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work. And are this like, what is the life of the kinetic battery? It runs for a long time. Yeah, it charges into some form of... It's a smaller cell, which it charges into. And the size of a watch battery, because they use them quite frequently and watch it. And that would last for... Well, I don't... I'm not entirely sure how long it would last, but I've never seen one run out. But then if you think about watch, it's on your wrist, but it's on your body the whole time. Yeah. So you're walking around you doing things. It is moving a lot of the time. Yeah, and... I mean, you switch the TV on and you put it on the side, then you pick it up to change it and you put it on the side. Yeah, but then again... Are you going to be enough? I think it is, because if you think about it, watch, although it's only a tiny amount. It's always moving for the whole day. And they don't run out overnight when you leave them on the side. And for the same reason, you're only using it for an incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal. And then you're finished with it. And you put it on it. No, no, I don't think the... I could actually start... We're hurrying back to solar charging. Is that compatible with standard batteries? I mean, could people put standard batteries in, but they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging? No, the two things are not compatible. Yeah, I think you could have a dual power thing. But the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case. Because if you... On a calculator, they're quite big and they all look identical. They're not exactly... They're expensive, they're... Normal batteries for the cheapest. Yeah, the normal batteries would be the cheapest. I presume that it would actually be the solar charging ones. But it's... I think they're not very resistant to dropping. Because if you drop stuff, yeah, if you have the size you'd need to charge a remote, it wouldn't be that big. But I mean, if... Remote always get thrown around and stuff. So... I think... Yeah, practically. I mean, calculators, you don't really throw around a lot. Whereas, remote's do. They can't... Don't care because they just have a battery in the world. Yeah, they do. They've got dual things, but the battery is smaller, I think. I think... Which one would last the longest? Because we don't want customers to be charging like a mobile phone every day. A remote control like that. So... Yeah, so... Look at the life also. Yeah, the... If you had something... Using the standard batteries and the solar charging... I don't think you... I think the... Well, you know how long the standard double-aids would last in or... It would just discharge from the attractiveness of the whole feature. But I think it would. Yeah. Okay, can we add in... In the attachment to clothing feature? Okay. Can we think about that? Because if we're doing the kinetic thing... Yeah. Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in? Because I... I've never heard of it before. I didn't think about it. Right, okay. Because... Where am I? If it is the kinetic thing... And... It is small and it is portable and it is... A different shape. Now the kinetic is something people don't do. Kind of... We're doing something original and different. But if you wore it, if it's something you could just click on your pocket... Then you would have that less. You wouldn't lose it. Yeah. So much. But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than... The eternal battle for a control of it. It's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research. It's not a thing that people are looking for. Okay. And we're still open to the field. Okay. But it's something to put on the side to think about then. Okay, right. Okay, well I'll move on. My second part of my findings... The most current remates use this silicon PCB board... Which... Printed circuit board. Which basically has these contacts that are really close together. And then when you press down on the rubber button, it'll connect the circuit. And each switch is connected to different legs on the chip. And so it sends a different message. And that then gets translated by the chip into a code. And then it's fired out of this LED in a sequence of on and off bursts. What kind of things do we have to consider there? Can we... What kind of slides... Does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size? Well... And we would have to fit the... Well, the thing about it is... They can be as big or as small as you want them to be. Because you can print a circuit board like that. So it's simply space-like that. So you can have fit the size of the nine buttons in. If you see how thin the tracks are, you could... You could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one if you wanted to. But there is an option to do it like that. Or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit. So that... And then to... Yeah, so to conserve battery life, we're making sure to be in a stand by mode. While not being used. Now what I was thinking about that was... Because sometimes when you have these things, they've got little lights on behind the buttons. So you can see what all the buttons are. Like on a mobile phone, they do it more often than on a... Then on a TV remote. But you could have lights behind the buttons. After like five or ten seconds and not being used, I'd have that turned off. If we decided to go for buttons that could light up. The case material, I've been sent what the factory can actually give us. There's the plastic which I think we were going to go for anyway, as the main case housing. And the main problems with the... Well, you could go for wood, but I think it would be a bit impractical. Titanium, very expensive. Just the process which to make it is expensive. And rubber. Well, you're saying that people like this spongy field. So perhaps something made of rubber. I was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which they've said... They've put across. What is used in some stressful manufacture. And it's meant to be anti-RSI. I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances. But that's what they said. The problem with the casing is that there's quite... There's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case. If you go for titanium, they can only do a standard box shape. Whereas if you come to plastic, they can be a little more... They can do sort of curved shapes. But whether or not, because we'd have it in two separate units. For the flip-fone. And second question is mobile, you can change the cover. Call it a skin over the world. In this case, you'll be looking at a custom-made change of color from green, parrot green to chili red or something like that. Is that feature available in titanium? Or is it only specific to plastic? In titanium, I don't think it would be available at all really. Well, you could make it available in the titanium. It would be so expensive to buy a new case for it. Because of the expensive, how much titanium is light and strong. But I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for... It does not work quite easily too. If you let it fall, I've got a mobile phone myself, which is titanium. It's a brand new brand, it's a brand new product. I'm just wondering if we make the basic mold out of plastic, but have a rubber cover that you give the spongy feel. That also allows us to have different parts. And you can peel them off. Instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic, the fascia that comes off with the rubber. Like those pens that you get with the grip. That could be a good idea. It could be comfortable to hold on. Very cheap way of changing the look of it. And people can just buy a new one. Well, that's been really popular with mobile phones, so I don't think why not. Also, just going back to the interface size with the buttons. We were planning to do some sort of touch screen. Now, what I was saying before about instead of having... You could have just a bare PCB circuit board. I'm sure you could probably get it in different colors. And say just by touching it with your finger, it would make the connection. If you had them close enough, that would be one option. The second option, they offer rubber buttons. But I thought that an LCD type of screen. Because one, they're incredibly thin. And don't take on mud space. Two, they... You can have them in a sort of... A rain. You could arrange the buttons on the screen, in a sort of sat thing. You could have them like a touch. So I didn't get the last part. You took the last part. Oh, what? Just what you said, adding good the meaning of it completely. Oh, on the LCD screen. You could... You could fit it... The problem with it basically is that it's flat. And so you can't do lots of curved things with it. But you wouldn't have... With the LCD, you'd have the wires coming off. You wouldn't have that with the... With the LCD. You'd only have that with the printed circuit board. With... I should... Sorry to interrupt. I don't see why the curved thing is a problem. If we, for example, had a shell. Yeah. Once we open that, it's like... You can have a flat screen inside. Yeah. But I'm just wondering whether we want an LCD screen inside. It wouldn't be like full color. It would just be black and white. But there'd be touch... Touch buttons. So you wouldn't be pressing down on them. Or we could have rubber buttons, which are made of this material, which is anti-ISON. I think it would be good to have a contrast between if the whole thing... It's rubber. ...is rubber saying it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy. Yeah. Now, how would you distinguish... How would you compare it to where you had to press? Yeah, I hadn't really thought that. It's just another idea. I don't know if it helps with that. But just to do with the RSI. Is it possible? Just as an option. When we open it up, people can use their fingers to press the button. Or we have inside a small pointer thing. Yeah, you could have some sort of stylus thing. You could pull out. But... I think they could get a bit easily lost. Yeah. It's easy to replace as well. Somebody who serves very often. A person who switches channels very often or does user particular function very often. Yeah. You'll find it very irritating to use earlier. Yeah. And he might spoil the touchpad very fast compared to a button like... Yeah. ...if he keeps punching with a point over it. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Just to show... We wouldn't actually need one in the queue if anything they've got. Couldn't be a pencil or a pen. So we wouldn't really need a... Okay, we'll talk about that. So if you finish here, you can buy to that. Yeah, that's the end. I've never seen this before. I've never seen this before. Like, you're listening. Regarding the circuit since we have... ...having a flip top. Yeah. We can customize the two circuits for different type of buttons. Like, we are keeping the standard buttons on the top. Oh, yeah. We can't fix the button in the distance. So we can divide the circuit like that. Yeah, yeah. That would be fairly simple. I mean, you'd actually have two separate... You'd have two separate circuit boards, but they'd be joined by wires or... Okay. ...like some cabling between them. Because in the actual flip that you'd have some linking. I'll just raise another point. Well, it occurs to me. It kind of applies to both our designers here. I'm not sure how it would fit in. If we flip open, now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs. There are mirrors when you turn to them, and you turn away, and it gives like an advertising display. You see those? And... And they kind of respond to the turn of your body. Is it possible that when we open our flip top shell, it's a little compact mirror. And when you press a button, it then goes on to the phone display. Or the remote control display thing. We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women. I don't look at themselves. Just a thought. Well, it's remote control. You were sitting watching TV. Yeah. Are you going to want to sort of open it in? I know what you mean. It's like I'm using the idea of mobile phones. So they're using the idea of mobile phones. I've got a slight track down to that, I think. Okay. I'm just trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much. But one of the things that we'll understand. Yeah. Okay. I mean, you can't. You could do it. You could have a... Because if you... If you just put the full charge through an LCD display or completely blank it out. But I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it. I think I'll be sure to get about the mirror. That was just a very quick passing thought. Okay. Okay. I'm... I'd like to share something which I did here. First thing is basically on design. We just took the input from the previous meeting, especially from the marketing and industrial design. To check on the customer needs and feasibility. Second is we checked into competitors. The picture here shows what are the standard models offered by competitors here. So you generally see there is not much of variety. And like marketing teams said people need trendy. They are bored of black and white. So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here. And second thing is there is too much of confusion here. No particular remote is standard. Like some people have here. You see this? This is all... I found out that the only common feature is the channel control and the volume control. So there are other buttons there in a very disorganized. And they are not consistent with other models. Okay. And second, as I already discussed with William, we are going to have maybe a GUI interface in the middle of the flip top. Sorry, what is the search term? Graphic user interface. Basically which is what we do in computer. Have icons or touchpad over to... If you have like buttons appear on the screen and the LCD screen. Like you have an icon or something. So it is a good example of GUI, graphic user interface. So basically a person need not point or click or press any particular device. He just has to click on that particular icon. And on the top, repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing. And could be on the pointing device. That means use of button. So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent. So we are having a combination of both. So on this simpler board on the top, we have this button, rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels. Can we swap that round? So the one that we use all the time on the bottom part? In fact, if you think about holding it, you would be using your thumbs to press. Just like the mobile phone. You told it you don't have to flip it open and you'd be... Wouldn't you? Isn't that the idea? If we just use the shell as an example again, you open that. You've got your LCD display there and you've got the buttons there. She holds it in the bottom. That's why I was just saying. I can't do it in the thumb line. And then have the LCD at the top. And then be able to touch that for the other... Okay, try to have the volume and the program, things like that. And the lower. On the lower. Okay. So the findings are too many clotted buttons. Repetition of certain buttons, which I already explained. Example the volume and channel control buttons. All are confusing and inconsistent. Okay, we had a latest finding of voice recognition. There was a mail which mentioned that our division has developed a new speech recognition feature. We have to check into the financial feasibility, whether we can incorporate this at a low cost. But for like we had response from the customer that they would like to have the feature of finding it. So it could be like where is the remote and the remote answers, I am here. Yeah. Some kind of thing or it gives a blip sound or some kind of sound. And if this can be incorporated, this would be more... You can say trendy also and technologically innovative also. Yeah. So we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this. My personal preferences would be like, as already highlighted by the marketing department, they want something to do with fruit. So I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit. But yeah, we can take inspiration from fruit colors like the vibrant colors. A red chili. Yeah. Two mitre red or whatever. And second thing is certain standard buttons we should have. For example, if you see the previous slide. Yeah. I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this central pattern here. Yeah. So we would not change that particular pattern because this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls. I can't see that. That play and stop. This is central one. The one you have. That volume and channel. So keep that standardize because that's the most common feature across all models. If you look at all the models, it's here. This. And. Voice recognition. Okay. Right. Okay. I'm not sure how long we've got left. But we need to make a decision about things we discussed. So we agree on. Do we agree on the battery? Kinetic. Kinetic. Yeah. Um, that means that there's no function for the port, you know, that it sits in the impression button that having. So we could incorporate voice recognition. Yeah. I think it's like a gadget. It's a gadget. Yeah. It is. It's quite a cool feature tab. And also, if they've got it, if they've got these parts already in stock, then it won't be cheap to remanufacturing. Or they will be cheap, so to remanufacturing. So do you recommend to get idea of that? Where's the remote? I'm here thing. I think that would be quite fun. I think the only. I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost. That means we have to cut down somewhere else. But I think pretty much. We. Is. Well, it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full color, because if we just got a black and white one, I mean they used them in calculators. Maybe we could start with the black and white. Yeah. That would be good. Yeah. Upgrade later on. We talked about kinetic charging. We just seemed to have decided on that. Did we decide on double your triple batteries? You want like a backup? No. One of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double your triple batteries, because they still got to be charged. So I haven't those. No, the kinetic one. Oh, I see. Come with the sort of battery that goes in the watch. Right. Okay. So it's a lot smaller. So it would. Got you on that. Okay. Okay. Got battery. The inside components is pretty standardised across the board. Yeah. So there's not really a decision to be made there. The buttons. What did you give us as a zone? The bareboard LCD. Yeah, I think we were going for the LCD on that one. On the buttons. On the top one. On the top one. Okay. You've got the touch. Yeah. Okay. And then. On the bottom we were going to have to rub the anti-ISI ones. Okay. Okay. So could you repeat that last part? Okay. I'll see the flip screen. The flip screen. The top one is going to be the LCD and the bottom one is going to be the rubberized button. Okay. And products. No. So the body design, I think, plastic. Plastic. Yeah. Okay. If it's inside for the inside end. Yeah. Rubber as a padding or for the crypt something like to add to the design. So we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell and a variety of designs. Okay. And it is just a always rubberized and spongy. Apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours. We're not going to try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else in the shell. No, I think it kind of is. We don't want to be tacky if we've got a different shape anyway. The material that we would be using would be cheap. We could make it red, we could make it psychedelic. You know, we could make it black and white, there are stripes. But that's not really what we're focusing on. The feel. Yes. So you can just pick anything. Is that going to be the image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that? Maybe about that size. Made of plastic fits into the palm of the hand, rubberized cover that's spongy. Is that really going to fit fancy looking feel which was the major thing that people wanted market research? Is that slightly different? It's just different from everything else. I mean, I'm trying to imagine clean looking houses sort of beige and black. Do you either want something that goes with that which is what's on the market anyway? Or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than actual clocks. Yeah, because they're so in there. I'm just kind of pushing it that to see if you came out with anything else. But I totally agree. We looked at those remotes. I mean, there are kind of anonymous, very similar looking things. This would definitely be different. I just wanted if anybody could come up with something. And you would just have a cross that you would have so many different options you could do. You could have a plain black one. You could have sparkly pink. Well, the things that rubberized covers are going to be serratively cheap to produce. If in a year's time we get feedback from the design fears that show something else is coming out. It's so easy to be able to produce that that can be slipped on. And watch the beauty of it. The ones that have rubbery spikes. You know, it just goes so far with it. Like a puffer face. You could just take it wherever. So I think that's quite a flexible. And finally the body should be detachable. Maybe you can change the body of the case kissing the case outside. It should be more loaded with the design in such a way you can change it every time. Yeah, yeah, with these rubber, these rubberized. Not the actual plastic outside case, just the rubber. Okay, you guys will need to change. Okay, we've got five minutes. That might have been up for a while. So can I just recap, Sarah? Yeah. The decisions that we've made, kinetic charging, the watch type batteries. LCD display on the top side of the flip top rubberized buttons on the bottom side. We're going to use fruit and vegetable colors for the rubber to cover the case itself is plastic. That's how far we've got what else do we have to add to our decisions here? Fine, we're talking of a voice recognition also. Because we have not addressed the issue of how to locate remote control if it's lost. Yeah, we're just a cost issue with that, but it's a good idea. We just need to check on the cost. So we'll be like William was suggesting the last thing some devices you put on key chains. Oh, yeah, yeah, the whistle once. The whistle. So we can financially voice recognition is not visible. We could go for a whistle. And incorporating the company logo. I'm sorry, but we'll be incorporating in the design. Because I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from your report. It's not just a case of having a little RR hidden somewhere. They do want it to be obvious that it's our product. Well, they do, but I think we can. Since it's the only one of its kind on the market, obviously going to be a... Well, it is. I think you just addressed that with advertising. You associate the name with the individual product, but it is. And that doesn't work for you. Obviously you'll have a logo on it just like everything, but everything else has a logo on it. The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently. I think it does. And that we're trying that. Did we... I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper. I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location. Have we just rejected that and be the voice recognition? Depending on how... Yeah, depending on the expense of it. I mean, we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company is looking into. And we've got in stocks. That seems to make sense, but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive, we'd have to cut down somewhere else. Then it's worth thinking about. But I think we'll find out more about the product afterwards. Right, I'm going to wrap this up saying. I've got an end meeting now, right? Did it? Yeah. Sorry. I've been a bushing out. So I think we've probably got... Instead of going so soon, we have 40 minutes. So I think we've probably got about that time before we come back. See that that already? We only had 40 minutes to discuss what we've discussed. I don't know how long that took. I think we're pretty going in a clear direction now. Is everyone happy? That's good. Okay.
