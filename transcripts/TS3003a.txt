Good morning. Good morning. I see you all find your places. Everybody's sitting on the right place. Let's see. First I'll introduce myself. I don't know if everybody knows me. I'm Bart. Hello. Hello. Bart. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Bart. Welcome. Thank you. Let's start off with a little presentation. First I'll tell you a little bit about the sitting. You can see the few cameras here. They'll record our actions. And you all have wires and microphones. They will record your voice. There are also some microphones there. But you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those because it will disappear when you don't intend to do it. These are project documents folder. There are some notes in it already. I see some documents. I'll start with the presentation. Kick off. I'm being modified by the administrator. Okay. Let's do it readownly. Well, I don't know if you've noticed, but we're working for real reaction. It's a company in electronics. We put fashion in electronics. We make it work. We put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself. I'm Bart Bout, I'm a project manager. So I'll direct you through the project. This is our agenda. We have our opening equipment and stool training project plan discussion closing. Maybe I can sit down. Then I can take some notes. Or let's see. Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while. Sure. I don't know. It's not a lot of work. If you hear something, you can write down. You can see it's the opening. The maintenance stool training. The maintenance point we've done a bit. Have you all seen the corporate website already? Have you seen any flaws in it? I think I found one. I can't sorry, I paid much attention to it. I see if it works. No, it doesn't work here. No problem. But on the corporate information side, there's the... There was real remote instead of real reaction. Oh, yeah. Real remote is not really the company we are. It's just a little. Beautiful. Okay. What are we going to do? Our project aim is, as you can see, a new remote control. It has to be original, trendy, and user-friendly. So these are the points where we also hired you. We've got the marketing expert for the trendy and user-friendly look. And the industrial designer. That's also user-friendly and a bit original. And we've got our user interface designer. It's also... That's about the new remote control. Our project method is... There are three phases we're going through. First is functional design, individual work meetings. After the functional design, then the conceptual design and the detailed design. I had some real indications on here. But I think you know it already by yourself. The industrial designer is going to work on the working design, components design, and a bit of the look and feel design. The user interface designer is going to do the technical function design. Use the interface concept and use interface design. And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirements, specification, trend-watching, and project evaluation. So that's a bit what you're going to do. That will all be worked out in other meetings. Then we've got our first tool training. We're going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here. So it's handy if we have a little bit of training first. As you can see, we've got the smart boards here and here, and the white boards. In the white board here, there's a little toolbar on this side. Here are some functions we can save. These functions we don't have anything to do with. Only undo you can undo a little piece of drawing. A blank new document for each person. Select a pen, razor, capture redone, that's to do anything with. Then we've got our pen. This pen is really funny because you can draw with it on this page. I think it is formal. You can also select the current color and the line width. But that first you have to select the pen function. We're going to work with it in a minute. That's very simple and it's easy to draw your findings. Drawings in there. Then a sure thing about documents. We've got our shared folder. Project documents. But you all found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already. So it will be okay. These are available on the smart boards as well. So if you have a document you want to show, just open it from the folder. Here is the simple toolbar. It's what I just said. It's a safe print. Move back or forward one page. You can switch between the different drawings. Then we're going to try out the whiteboard. So as you can see we go to draw an animal. Just to get a bit familiar with it. I was supposed to run away. Is anybody playing with the mouse? We're going to draw an animal. Just sum up a few of its favorite characteristics. The only thing we have to look after is that we use different colors and different lines with this. I can start from now. You can use this pen by holding it like a little child. Because if you hold it like this, the sensors will get blocked and the drawing won't get good. Another thing is you have to be a bit slow. Because if you're going to draw it really fast then the pen won't hold up. So it used Format, Current Color. I think gray is appropriate. Then the line width. I think 7 will be nice. Now you will see my drawing capabilities. He's another very much. See here you have to do it real slow. That was it. I'm trying to draw a dolphin. I'm thinking about a short fish. It's a bit of a short fish. Now we've got another function. We've got the eraser. And then you can do this easily. That's OK. I've got to write down a few of his characteristics. It's... You've got no text tool? No. OK. This is typically a do action I think. Maybe I have to hold it a bit upside down. I think that's it because if you are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe. I don't know. Just trying. This is not my work. Maybe I have to use it. I think it's a one to draw another animal. It lives for the fin. It's my characteristic about the dolphin. It lives for the fin. Now I'm going to hand over the pen on a new blank sheet. Go ahead. Use a different line. I'm going to draw in black. OK. I'm not much an artist but here we go. Maybe it's easier to draw with a smaller line. I'm going to love that and I did. I'm going to use a different line. I'm going to use a different line. OK. This is my sheep. It's nice. Blue dot is always sprayed on your butts. It's a real dead sheep. Maybe you can also write your name somewhere. Let's go really slow when you're writing. Yeah. They're brilliant animals and that's just a little me thing. I'm just going to draw with a head. Yeah. OK. Sweet. I'm going to draw with a head. Garfield. Yeah. Well I was going to draw a cat too so I'll just try something else. Something different than Garfield. Mine is a bit more skinny. But what about the most interesting tool? Is it your cat or did you find him on the street? Well it's supposed to be a cat. I like cats because they are independent. So that's pretty clear. Everybody knows how to work with the wide board now. If you have any ideas or if you want to draw anything on the wide board just ask and go ahead. It's pretty easy. And a haunted wide board. So we've got the tool introduction. Move along to the project finance. As you can see for remote control selling price is 25 euros. Our profit aim is 50 million euros. That's the least we have to get from our remote controls. So we have to work together to reach our aims. We can do it international. So we have to focus on different kind of users, different kind of cultures and different kind of trends as well. But that's all in the later stadium. Our production cost can be maximum 12 and a half euros. So that's also a point we have to keep in mind that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside and stuff like that. Point work. So just try to remember these points. Selling price is 25 profit aims, 50 million. But more important is the international market we're trying to focus on. And production cost is maximum 12 and a half euros. So that leads us to our little discussion. We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion. So I'm going to sit down and think. It's easier. I've got a message. Five minutes. Okay, that's a good timing. So just on the side note, why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen? Maybe you have to say the magic word. Yeah. Does it do anything? No. Maybe you have to just clap it down. Back up again. The slideshow. It's off. It's off. I have to put it back. Yeah, it'll be okay. What was on? It's those laptops. Oh, there we are. Nice. Okay. But, um, this everybody has experiences with remote controls. And I mean, not the ordinary remote controls, but also a little bit different ones. Like you can use for other. No, really. Well, we're on the radar. Kind of brought TV at home. And the DVD player. We got like a lot of remote controls, one for the TV, one for the video recorder, one for the DVD player. And I think it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate the mall. Yeah. Yeah, I've got one at home. And you can program, I think, eight different devices in it. And you can use it for your television and anything else. And it also operates on infrared. So you have to got a little device inside your room. And then you can operate it from the third or second floor. Oh, really? So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or DVD player downstairs. And you've got a link to your TV on the second floor. Yeah. So that's a pretty handy thing. But I think if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well. Yeah. It's good to remember. So I think you can take minutes again. Yeah, that's nice. Thank you. That's a great job. So we want different functions. Yeah. And we can maybe see if we can do something with infrared. But I don't know if that will exceed the production cost. There's something we have to find out, I think. Yeah. But that would be really good if we could do that. And other functions for remote control. Maybe we can make it. It has to be sharp proof. My remote control tends to follow a lot. So should never have. I mean, what I prove. Okay. So these are a few things we can think of. I will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder. Yeah. And I think it's a little bit more than a little thing. I thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it. So I can see a battery status. Okay. How much is left in the battery? But they'll also really drag up the production costs. Yeah. They'll have to see about that too. But maybe just a little lead. That's an idea as well. Other ideas? Quick ideas. They were all mentioned. Any questions about this presentation? Click off presentation. Okay. Okay. Then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder. And then we can all work. Finish meeting now. Okay. And we can all work on our own projects. Okay. Then I'll meet you in about half an hour, I think. Okay. So good luck. Okay. Okay. Okay.
