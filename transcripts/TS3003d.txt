Hello. Good afternoon. Sorry I'm a little late. Oh, brilliant. Good to stuck in the traffic. Okay. It's possible this time of day. It starts at the end of the day. It starts at 3 o'clock. Yeah. Let me see. Our fourth and last meeting. There he is. Yes. Okay. This is our last meeting. This meeting we will discuss our final design. And we will do some evaluation about not only the product, but also the project. And then we're going to close the project today as well. So after that you'll be free to go and spend all your money. And this design, detailed design meeting, we will discuss the look and feel of the design, the usability interface design, and we will do the product evaluation. In order to do that, we have this agenda. We will have the prototype presentation first. Then we will set up some evaluation criteria. Then we will look at the finance. We will have to see if everything we want to do is also possible within our budget. Because everything costs money. And the more functions you want to have, the more money it will cost. So we have to see if it fits within the 12.5 euro per remote. We will see that later. Then we will do the project evaluation and the closing after that. We've got 40 minutes. So we will be finished at half past three. But first, we will do the prototype presentation. So if somebody wants to sit forward. Well, this is what me and Richard came up with. The default spot for the on-off button. The mute button just below that. Then there is the volume and channel selectors. A simple plus minus button. We thought of a help button. If you hold it and you press another button, the help goes to the LCD screen. Then there is the 0 to 1 to 0 buttons. A button for teletext, a button for the subtitles and the company logo. So it's rather a simple prototype. And we will have to see from testing how the user is taking it. Is this the moment where we ask? Where can I ask questions about the functionality? Sure. Just pop in at any time. When you are in teletext, usually your buttons where you just press it and you go to the next teletext page. That's just the normal remote controls. You push it, you come in page 100. You can use the normal 1 to 0 buttons. You can also use the button for changing the channel. So the shifting button. For the shifting up in the teletext and shifting down. Okay. But I thought in a few meetings earlier we tried to give it a simple, just a few buttons and large buttons. But I think these are all together. Quite a few buttons. So I'm wondering if we really need all of those buttons. I think if you look at most controls, they've got more buttons than this. And well, the on-off button is a necessity. You can't drop that one. The volume and channel buttons, you obviously need those. The mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume down button twice. So we could cancel that one. I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does. Or you can build in when you press one button. Long time. We just discussed that already. I think all people don't know that option. So they just put in the press. Yeah. Well, you can't leave out the number buttons, I guess. And take some subtitles. So it's rather basic already. That's what I pointed out earlier. You just make control for just the TV. There's just not much to gain here. Yeah. Okay. So yeah, somebody about something about the design of the buttons there? Yeah, there. It's not a hard to draw on the whiteboard, but they're supposed to be equal sized round with a little logo on it for the volume, the triangle and stuff. Just for recognition. Yeah, and we don't need a letter or some remote controls. Because we use the little display, we don't have to use it. So for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons with a different color than the case. So they jump out. Okay, that's about it. It's nice. Then because we only have 30 minutes left, I will move on to the finance part, which is pretty exciting to see if it's all possible what we want to do. And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for 12.5 euros. I don't know if I'm building correctly, so just correct me if you see something wrong. I counted two batteries, but maybe we can also use one. I don't know if it's possible. It's rechargeable. It's rechargeable. That's right. Okay. That's two euros off. We need the advanced chip, so there's not much to say there. Here we have the single curved. We can see that the difference between end curved and the single curved is one euro. I don't know, but I think the single curved is good for the design and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control. I think we have to keep that. Then we have the case material supplements. It's plastic. It's the cheapest one we need. So that's not much to say for either. But then the biggest cost are the buttons. So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our cost though. Because we will have to get 12.5 euros at the end. So let's first count the buttons we have now. Because I have 16. That will be even more than 18 euros. 17. 17. Okay. Including the help. Yeah. 17. I think we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long or pressing down a number. Yeah. Long. That saves us one euro already. Then we have got 15 I think. Wouldn't you have 15 buttons? I assume you count the volume and channel thing for two buttons each. Those are one. I think. Well, I think actually there are two buttons. It's just one better. Two for one big bell. But they are more expensive than the small ones. Yeah, but it's not stated in this. So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume in the channel in one by pressing. Well, I think maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button. That's the possibility as well. That would cut the costs. So and it's good for the design as well. So you can make. Let's see. If you make this. It looks a bit like a cross. I mean. But I don't know if it's still got four buttons. So yeah, I think they count the materials. Not a better, better itself, but on the chip there. Yeah, you got still for that's right for betting. But I think because we have the funds chip. Yeah, but we can just count this as one button. But now that I think I think this really is for buttons. And yeah, yes. Yeah. Maybe it is, but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the 12 and a half euros. Also the LC display. I think it's too expensive for the display we use. I think they try it. If we leave out the display, we can also save money on the chip. That's right. But what's the biggest foundation of our remote then? Only the docking station, I guess. Yeah. And the docking station isn't even in this schematic. No, it's not even taken into the price. That's extra. That's right. Maybe we should move to a different supplier. That's an option. Poland, something. Polish player. Don't you think we can, if we can count this as one button and integrate these buttons in three? Then we save a lot of money as well. We could save money on it, but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people? Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. My mother can't even send a nasa-mess message. So, yeah. That's a point. We kind of buy remote control when you can use it. So, yeah. We must stay below the 1250 or yeah. Can't the go up. Well, since the market research indicated that all their people spend their money easier, it's more easy. Maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little, especially since we have those nice features. Yeah, but we have to stick to the 1250. We don't have any more budget to the margin. We have to get too small. That's possible to make one for 1250. I don't think so. If you leave out the LCD display, and if you use less buttons, you can take a single chip. There it is. Do you want to make a bidon? So, fancy and good. Good looking. Yeah. Effective option. You can stay below 1250. I think it's difficult as well. Basically, becoming a choice between either a good remote and a higher production cost or just any other remote control. Or we can leave out the 10 buttons and take one scroll wheel for the program numbers. Because then we save 10 buttons and we have 5 and 1. Let's see if we have this one and we've got the advanced. We're getting closer. We can get closer. How would a scroll wheel work here? Then you will... Maybe you can... Scroll... If you scroll, you will see the numbers on the LCD display until you've got the right number, and you push it. That would bring up the price of the scroll wheel also. Okay, but then you can push some other buttons as well. You could just not scroll for half a second. That's right. If you scroll to a number and you wait a half second, then it turns to that channel. I think that would be the end of our usability. It would definitely drop costs a lot. And we need the battery. And the regular chip is not possible. It has to be advanced. If you want to use an LCD screen, you need an advanced chip. And we can save a Euro by a flat design. That's an option we can... Then we're almost there. If you could just leave out one more button. Or we have to skip the subtitle button. But I think that is a big advantage for us. Can we integrate the text and the subtitles in one button? If you push it... Three titles. Right now you just push the Teletex button. Go to page 888. And the Teletex disappears, but the subtitles stay there. But if you push it, it's a bit too wide. What if you have to scroll to page 888? That could be just the scroll to 8. Scroll to 8. But then again, that would be just pretty much an option for older people. Don't even know what a scroll wheel is. Holding a remote with a day of respect to have like ten buttons for the numbers 1 to 0. There are only five buttons on it. And a scroll wheel. I think if you make a good advertisement on television and in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel. You just make it real simple. Because it saves a lot of money and we can keep our LCD screen, which can provide extra information how to use the scroll wheel, how to use the other buttons as subtitles. And it's good for the innovative design as well. If you would erase these, you're raising. It looks a bit odd, maybe. It's a pretty big scroll wheel. It's something like that. Then you've got the scroll wheel. One, two, three, four, five buttons. So if we erase this one, these are two buttons then. We could wake two buttons out of that. If you press the volume button, you can control the volume with the scroll wheel. So that would save two buttons if you do the same for the channel. That's really a good idea. And that will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious indeed. So we make one for the volume, one for the channel. Please scroll. So if we... That's right. So we've got one, two, three. We can leave the text in if we want. So it's better. If we leave out all those buttons perhaps you can go with the flat case and make it smaller overall. So if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button, the screen right under that then the scroll button. You get a much smaller remote. That's right. So we can decrease this one to four buttons. Right now we have five. You can make quite a big remote control for just the same price as a small one. You have to pay for the double curved or single curved. It's more the moles in which they are being made I think. Single curved is really easy to fill in. The cases come right out of the machine. Single curved. You have to have a different machine than a flat one. I think this is a really easy one. But does everybody think about the flat or single curved design? What do you think? Well, I still think we should go for the single curved design. Richard argument was very good. We have to cut costs. Yeah. I'm going to just go to the board and ask for more money. I'm agreeing with the use of the research and see what the options are. I think we can then keep the single curved one. Express our LCD screen a bit more. People will use it more especially for the help functions. They'll be good if we have scroll bar scroll button. We'll be necessary to have a good help function as well. Sorry, this is scroll. I think it was better to have this price this bit earlier before we went on to them. To the whole design. But I'm glad we could make a bit. Yeah. That's pretty different. This is not really like for the group we were making or remote. This will really require a lot of marketing. Yeah. To get this to sell. Other people like familiar forms and familiar stuff. This is not familiar for them. But I think we have to do a lot of convincing them. I think the most. But they know the scroll buttons from old radio. They also buttons like that for changing. We can stick it out. Like an old button. Maybe that's recognizable for them as well. That's a good one. I'm afraid we have to move on. It's less frightening I think. If they see this design they think there are only five buttons. But we will see. It might be confusing too. There's definitely only five buttons. Very special. I would buy. Yeah, but you're not 60. That's right. I would buy if I was 60. No, I didn't know. Are the question of 12 and a half euros? No. Yes, they are. No. No, but we can go on with the project evaluation. Let's see. I think we still have 50 minutes left. So nice on schedule. Yeah. The project process. So I like set up all these criteria. A evaluation criteria. That's right. That was the thingy. The point I forgot. There we are. Evaluation criteria. Thank you. Go ahead. We've got five minutes, I think. Five more minutes. No, we've got 15 minutes. Okay. Yes. Okay, so I did some literature study. Analysis of the requirements. We set up earlier. Translated it into criteria, which would be these. Is the remote fancy? The shape, look and feel? Inovative? What new functions are there? Easy to use. Learnability is a very important factor here. Is it functional? Are there not too many functions? Are there useful? The cost? The target group is the remote really for the group. We're making it for. Great occupability. If our company is easily recognizable, they are company made it. So we're supposed to evaluate it right now. Okay. Let's see. I have to say this was a little hard because the minutes over the last meeting. We're not here. Yeah, that's because my pen failed to upload his data. Okay. I tried to, but it's giving errors by downloading software. Okay. Is the design fancy on a scale of 1 to 7? Yes. The whole bill for 6. Okay. Is the design inovative? Very. So with our LCD screen. Some tidal stations. But it's called buttons. Yeah. Seven. Seven? Yeah. So we've got 20 cents for our docking station. Should be the one. Yeah. Is the design inovative? Very. So with our LCD screen. Should we do all? Yeah. Is the design easy to use? Yes. That's a bit... Do it, gee. Well. It would be for us. But for all the people. I would say four. Four or five. Four or five. Between four. I'd go for four or two. Yeah. Is it functional? Is the design functional? Do we have all functions that we want to include? Yes. I think we do. Do we have too many functions? No. No, no. I think so. It's pretty slim. I think it's seven. Seven? Oh, and do we... Take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control. Like it getting lost. And... Sorry. We haven't thought of that one. It was. I think we do. I had them worked out. There are ugly, not very functional, and getting lost. Are the production costs within the preset limits? Well, they are now. Yeah. Does the design fit the group of focus? I think that's a free. Yeah. I think with a new radio button, I think it's better. We have the test. I don't know. I think it's too fancy to flash. I think the radio button is not exactly what older people expect of remote control. Yeah. True. How we give it a four? I'm not sure. I think I'd go for two. I'd go for three. So... Then we have to do three. It's kind of... Is the company recognizable? Yes. It is. The logo there. Yeah. So... And they want to put fashion in their products in the slogan of the company. And we have the removable front cases. Yeah. So I think it's very recognizable. Yeah. So there will be this. I was also supposed to calculate the score, but... Thought we would have another private... We have got a calculator after this. Think you have to... 20. Is this... Like after this are we done or... We've got the... We've got the... We've got the... Well, anyhow. These are seven factors. Time seven is 40. Something. Two. No. Nine. Nine is 40. 49. Minus one. Minus three. Minus four. Mm-hmm. Minus four. Minus eight. 41. 41. Out of 49. That's... All right. 80%. I guess we'll just touch them in the bottom here. Does 84%. I think that's a pretty nice score. Yeah. Okay. So that will be the evaluation. Okay. Thank you. So... That brings us to the project evaluation. Yeah. Thank you. Project process. Did we move through the right faces, you think, along the process? Yes. Yeah. I think we should have a... We should have had the finance thinking a lot earlier. Yeah. That's right. In the design phase. So, lack of information about prices. Yeah. That's true. Okay. Okay. So, this fiction... Was there room for creativity? Nope. Nope. Not too much now. It's because of the finance. Yeah. There wasn't room, but the finance. The room was... And I would have liked to go for the younger users also. And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own. Strictions. Internet access. Okay. Leadership. Was it clear what everybody had to do? According to their roles and functions. Yes. Teamwork. Did it work out? Working together. Also, you two, two of you with... Yeah, it was okay. Tosses. Nice. The tasks are very strictured, so you can just do step by step. And it was very easy. Structured tasks. Okay. Were there means sufficient for the tasks that we had to do? Or were there too much? Well, the smart board... The drawing is just a pain in the ass, but... The digital pen is very nice. If it wants to download this data. Smartboard was irritating. So you rather wanted to have a flip over? Or... A flip over? Or a more precise... Yeah. Faster as well. Yeah. Yeah. Flip over. But if you want to share... So when you make a picture like this on the presentation, it's easier to share it with other people. So you can save it and put it on the internet or... In shared folder or shared there. Yeah, I tried to open the file. It's on my laptop, but it didn't work. No, not possible. You need the smart board application, I think. But I think you can... Yeah. Should be possible. Yeah, you can export this image. Best... Yeah, best be. So the sharing of the information was okay? Pen is here. Yeah, that's where it works. Yeah, pen is here on the table. Yeah, yeah, JPEG, VMP. It's possible. Okay. Okay. That's nice. We've found new ideas for... Having this kind of meetings. Or... Yeah, maybe... When we... Just give the numbers... Or... Or out of... Yeah. It's easier to... To do things like that on the computer. Yeah. Just like... So, the university... Yeah. So everybody puts his own score. Yeah. And then it mediates the score and you can get one... Yeah. That's better. That's... How do we go? Information. Right here, yeah? Okay. Any more ideas or questions about the project or about the product? It goes, I think. Then let's get to our last week. Articles within the budget? Yeah. Considering we are not going to make a docking station. That's a good point. But maybe because of the docking station, the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher. Yeah. And I think you can compensate that as well. So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem because it's very cheap to make as well. Do we think we're going to get the $12.5 million? What was it? $15 million. I think we will. If we're going to export this product in Overtube, especially in America, people are pretty... Take a dent sometimes. Yeah, still don't think... I mean, if we're going to make a scroll button anyway, you can do more. You can do more for the younger people and for the older people. Yeah. So maybe we should just refocus. Just put it on the market for everybody. You can... You can change markets by changing the front cover. That's one thing you can change it with. So you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on the market, just as a test. You see how it works? That's I think a good advantage. Yeah, I think then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is. Then it would be with older people. Yeah. Even if it were, there are covers. Then I think we can have our little celebration right now. That's it. I think we still have to fill in one more questioner. Okay. I think... I don't know. I didn't get a message from the... from ending of the... Oh, I think I have one. Five more minutes. Oh, this guy's. Then we still have some questions. If somebody has some questions, they can ask them now. We can put these in the project folder as well. Let's put them in. Look. Export is. Picture I think. Yeah. Yeah. This is another... That's work, I guess. Somebody see the project folder? I don't. Hmm. My documents. Maybe they will save it. Yeah. I'll just put it in my documents and... That's okay. Okay. I think I'm going to make our final presentation now. Right, you're supposed to make it. And then I will be back in about 10 minutes to show you the final presentation. Okay. Okay. Summary of the project. Are we supposed to go into our room rooms again? Yeah, maybe we have to fill in our questioner. Yeah, I think you all get the questioner in your room. And then I'll meet you in... Think about 10 minutes. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Hopefully my panel download is software. Yeah. Or data. That would be nice. T-t-t.
